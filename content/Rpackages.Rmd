This blog is supported by a few R packages containing all functions, datasets and other utilities, which are necessary to work through posts, tutorials and books. The packages are:

* [aomisc](https://github.com/OnofriAndreaPG/aomisc)
* [AgriCensData](https://github.com/OnofriAndreaPG/agriCensData)
* [drcSeedGerm](https://github.com/OnofriAndreaPG/drcSeedGerm)
* [lmDiallel](https://github.com/OnofriAndreaPG/lmDiallel)

All packages are hosted on gitHub and can be installed from there. To do so, you need the 'devtools' package, so, if necessary, install this package first. Next, load this library and use the 'install_github()' function to install the three packages. For any problem, please, [email me](mailto:andrea.onofri@unipg.it)

```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("OnofriAndreaPG/aomisc")
install_github("OnofriAndreaPG/agriCensData")
install_github("OnofriAndreaPG/drcSeedGerm")
install_github("OnofriAndreaPG/lmDiallel")
```
