Weed density and species composition differed with rotation, tillage, and date of sampling within years. Fewer weeds were found in winter wheat-fallow than continuous winter wheat, winter wheat-lentil, or winter wheat-canola rotations. A dense infestation of downy brome developed in the continuous winter wheat rotation. In all rotations, more weeds were present in zero tillage plots than in either minimum or conventional tillage plots. Dandelion and perennial sowthistle densities increased slightly over years in the minimum and zero tillage treatments. Flixweed, field pennycress, wild buckwheat, and common lambsquarters densities decreased in zero till but densities of downy brome, redroot pigweed, and Russian thistle increased. Russian thistle was not well controlled with trifluralin and its density increased in the winter wheat-canola rotation.},

The eyespot-resistant cultivar Cappelle Desprez comprised more than 90 per cent of the acreage and this may be a factor reducing the incidence of eyespot under this type of cropping. The effect of husbandry practices such as previous cropping, date of sowing, and the time interval between ploughing and sowing, were examined in relation to the incidence of take-all. With increasing intensity of cropping there was an increase in the amount of nitrogenous fertilizer used but this appeared only to maintain yield in the face of increasing disease. It was possible to establish a limited relationship between the incidence of take-all at G.S.3 and that present at G.S.10-5. A highly significant effect of take-all at G.S.10-5 on yield was established.},

  volume = {61},

  abstract = {The analysis of data from dose-response studies has long been divided according to two major strategies: multiple comparison procedures and model-based approaches. Model-based approaches assume a functional relationship between the response and the dose, taken as a quantitative factor, according to a prespecified parametric model. The fitted model is then used to estimate an adequate dose to achieve a desired response but the validity of its conclusions will highly depend on the correct choice of the a priori unknown dose-response model. Multiple comparison procedures regard the dose as a qualitative factor and make very few, if any, assumptions about the underlying dose-response model. The primary goal is often to identify the minimum effective dose that is statistically significant and produces a relevant biological effect. One approach is to evaluate the significance of contrasts between different dose levels, while preserving the family-wise error rate. Such procedures are relatively robust but inference is confined to the selection of the target dose among the dose levels under investigation. We describe a unified strategy to the analysis of data from dose-response studies which combines multiple comparison and modeling techniques. We assume the existence of several candidate parametric models and use multiple comparison techniques to choose the one most likely to represent the true underlying dose-response curve, while preserving the family-wise error rate. The selected model is then used to provide inference on adequate doses.},

In particular, interest often focuses on calibration\textemdash{}that is, estimating the best treatment level to achieve a particular result. Often, data for such calibration come from experiments with split-plots or other features that result in multiple error terms or other nontrivial error structures. One such example is the time-of-weed-removal study in weed science, designed to estimate the critical period of weed control. Calibration, or inverse prediction, is not a trivial problem with simple linear regression, and the complexities of experiments such as the time-of-weed-removal study further complicate the procedure. In this article, we extend existing calibration techniques to nonlinear mixed effects models, and illustrate the procedure using data from a time-of-weed-removal study.},

  abstract = {A long-term double cropping wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and corn (Zea mays L.) experiment was conducted at Qiyang, Hunan, China, to study the effects of inorganic fertilizers on grain yields and soil properties and to identify the possible causes of yield trends. Six treatments of unfertilized control, N, NP, NK, PK, and NPK were included. The treatments (N, NP, NK, and NPK) where inorganic nitrogen (N) was added showed significant (P$<$0.05) yield declines of 76 to 114 kg ha-1 yr-1 for wheat and 94 to 260 kg ha-1 yr-1 for corn, respectively, except for corn yield in the NPK treatment in which the decline was not significant during a 15-yr (1990\textendash{}2005) period. Comparatively, the decline amounts in corn were much higher than in wheat. The yields of wheat and corn remained unchanged in the PK treatment. The total organic carbon (C), total N, phosphorus (P), and available P, potassium (K), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) contents of soil were either increased or decreased during the study period. Both the decreases of exchangeable calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) and increases of exchangeable hydrogen (H+) and Al3+ contents of soil in the treatments where inorganic N was applied were significant (P$<$0.05). The same four treatments showed significant pH declines ranging from 0.07 to 0.12 yr-1. Several lines of evidence point to decline of soil pH due to inorganic N fertilizer added as leading to the overall yield decline of wheat and corn. However, the yields of both crops increased significantly after lime application. In the long term, the farmers should be encouraged to use adequate lime based on a balanced approach to ensure sustainable productivity.},

  abstract = {SUMMARYThe Broadbalk Wheat Experiment at Rothamsted (UK) includes plots given the same annual applications of inorganic nitrogen (N) fertilizer each year since 1852 (48, 96 and 144 kg N/ha, termed N1 N2 and N3 respectively). These very long-term N treatments have increased total soil N content, relative to the plot never receiving fertilizer N (N0), due to the greater return of organic N to the soil in roots, root exudates, stubble, etc (the straw is not incorporated). The application of 144 kg N/ha for 135 years has increased total soil N content by 21\%, or 570 kg/ha (0\textendash{}23 cm). Other plots given smaller applications of N for the same time show smaller increases; these differences were established within 30 years. Increases in total soil N content have been detected after 20 years in the plot given 192 kg N/ha since 1968 (N4).There was a proportionally greater increase in N mineralization. Crop uptake of mineralized N was typically 12\textendash{}30 kg N/ha greater from the N3 and N4 treatments than the uptake of c. 30 kg N/ha from the N0 treatment. Results from laboratory incubations show the importance of recently added residues (roots, stubble, etc) on N mineralization. In short-term (2\textendash{}3 week) incubations, with soil sampled at harvest, N mineralization was up to 60\% greater from the N3 treatment than from N0. In long-term incubations, or in soil without recently added residues, differences between long-term fertilizer treatments were much less marked. Inputs of organic N to the soil from weeds (principally Equisetum arvense L.) to the N0\textendash{}N2 plots over the last few years may have partially obscured any underlying differences in mineralization.The long-term fertilizer treatments appeared to have had no effect on soil microbial biomass N or carbon (C) content, but have increased the specific mineralization rate of the biomass (defined as N mineralized per unit of biomass).Greater N mineralization will also increase losses of N from the system, via leaching and gaseous emissions. In December 1988 the N3 and N4 plots contained respectively 14 and 23 kg/ha more inorganic N in the profile (0\textendash{}100 cm) than the N0 plot, due to greater N mineralization. These small differences are important as it only requires 23 kg N/ha to be leached from Broadbalk to increase the nitrate concentration of percolating water above the 1980 EC Drinking Water Quality Directive limit of 11$\cdot$3mgN/l.The use of fertilizer N has increased N mineralization due to the build-up of soil organic N. In addition, much of the organic N in Broadbalk topsoil is now derived from fertilizer N. A computer model of N mineralization on Broadbalk estimated that after applying 144 kg N/ha for 140 years, up to half of the N mineralized each year was originally derived from fertilizer N.In the short-term, the amount of fertilizer N applied usually has little direct effect on losses of N over winter. In most years little fertilizer-derived N remains in Broadbalk soil in inorganic form at harvest from applications of up to 192 kg N/ha. However, in two very dry years (1989 and 1990) large inorganic N residues remained at harvest where 144 and 192 kg N/ha had been applied, even though the crop continued to respond to fertilizer N, up to at least 240 kg N/ha.},

The experiment was begun in 1978 at Foggia (Southern Italy). Two varieties of durum wheat, cv. Valgerardo and cv. Appulo, have been grown.

The effects of the treatments were greatly influenced by seasonal weather and by the specific behaviour of cultivars, which differed in their ability to use the nitrogen applied.

The trial has given good results from straw and stubble incorporation, in comparison with burning, at present, widely practiced by farmers.

Nitrogen fertilizer applied to crop residues was not very beneficial; the yields from the treatment with N only as a top dressing were almost the same of those from the treatments which received the lowest N dose (50 kg ha-1, with or without water, while the highest ones (100 and 150 kg ha-1) gave lower yields, not compensated by a corresponding improvement of grain quality.},

  abstract = {\textbf{Summary.} In this study, the benefits of chickpea\&\#8211;wheat rotation compared with continuous wheat cropping (wheat\&\#8211;wheat rotation) were evaluated for their effects on soil nitrate nitrogen, wheat grain yields and grain protein concentrations, and water-use efficiency at Warra, southern Queensland from 1988 to 1996. $<$p$>$Benefits in terms of wheat grain yields varied, from 17\% in 1993 to 61\% in 1990, with a mean increase in grain yield of 40\% (825 kg/ha). Wheat grain protein concentration increased from 9.4\% in a wheat\&\#8211;wheat rotation to 10.7\% in a chickpea\&\#8211;wheat rotation, almost a 14\% increase in grain protein. There was a mean increase in soil nitrate nitrogen of 35 kg N/ha.1.2 m after 6 months of fallow following chickpea (85 kg N/ha) compared with continuous wheat cropping (50 kg N/ha). This was reflected in additional nitrogen in the wheat grain (20 kg N/ha) and above-ground plant biomass (25 kg N/ha) following chickpea.$<$/p$>$ $<$p$>$Water-use efficiency by wheat increased from a mean value of 9.2 kg grain/ha. mm in a wheat\&\#8211;wheat rotation to 11.7 kg grain/ha.mm in a chickpea\&\#8211;wheat rotation. The water-use efficiency values were closely correlated with presowing nitrate nitrogen, and showed no marked distinction between the 2 cropping sequences. Although presowing available water in soil in May was similar in both the chickpea\&\#8211;wheat rotation and the wheat\&\#8211;wheat rotation in all years except 1996, wheat in the former used about 20 mm additional water and enhanced water-use efficiency. Thus, by improving soil fertility through restorative practices such as incorporating chickpea in rotation, water-use efficiency can be enhanced and consequently water runoff losses reduced.$<$/p$>$ $<$p$>$Furthermore, beneficial effects of chickpea in rotation with cereals could be enhanced by early to mid sowing (May\&\#8211;mid June) of chickpea, accompanied by zero tillage practice. Wheat of \&\#8216;Prime Hard\&\#8217; grade protein (\&\#x2265;13\%) could be obtained in chickpea\&\#8211;wheat rotation by supplementary application of fertiliser N to wheat.$<$/p$>$ $<$p$>$In this study, incidence of crown rot of wheat caused by \emph{Fusarium graminearum} was negligible, and incidence and severity of common root rot of wheat caused by \emph{Bipolaris sorokiniana} were essentially similar in both cropping sequences and inversely related to the available water in soil at sowing. No other soil-borne disease was observed. Therefore, beneficial effects of chickpea on wheat yields and grain protein were primarily due to additional nitrate nitrogen following the legume crop and consequently better water-use efficiency.$<$/p$>$},

  volume = {176},
  abstract = {This study was organized to investigate the bioavailability of Pb in soil, as affected by soil type and crop species. The four most representative forms of Pb in soil (exchangeable, bound to carbonates, bound to the Fe-Mn oxides, and bound to organic matter) were considered, and their respective contribution to the uptake of this metal was determined. Four edible crops (lettuce, radish, tomato, and Italian ryegrass) were grown in four soil types, both nonspiked and spiked with 200 mg Pb kg?1. Chemical analyses were carried out to determine the amount of Pb sorbed from the soil and stored in the different plant organs. The bioaccumulation factor (BAF) and the translocation factor were derived and used to compare plant species. Results showed that all the test plants sorbed 10 to 30 times more Pb from spiked soils, as compared with nonspiked soils. The BAF and translocation factor showed that, excluding Italian ryegrass, all the crops sorbed less Pb from the soils containing Ca carbonate. On the basis of BAF, lettuce, tomato, and Italian ryegrass could be classified as crops with high Pb uptake ability in all soils. Concerning the distribution of Pb within the plant, all species showed the tendency to store this metal mainly in roots. The translocation to above-ground organs was the highest with lettuce, tomato (with reference to non edible above-ground organs) and Italian ryegrass, whereas radish showed the lowest translocation ability, together with the lowest uptake ability.},

  title = {Mixed {{Model Formulations}} for {{Multi}}-{{Environment Trials}}},
  volume = {96},
  abstract = {When studying genotype x environment interaction in multi-environment trials, plant breeders and geneticists often consider one of the effects, environments or genotypes, to be fixed and the other to be random. However, there are two main formulations for variance component estimation for the mixed model situation, referred to as the unconstrained-parameters (UP) and constrained-parameters (CP) formulations. These formulations give different estimates of genetic correlation and heritability as well as different tests of significance for the random effects factor. The definition of main effects and interactions and the consequences of such definitions should be clearly understood, and the selected formulation should be consistent for both fixed and random effects. A discussion of the practical outcomes of using the two formulations in the analysis of balanced data from multienvironment trials is presented. It is recommended that the CP formulation be used because of the meaning of its parameters and the corresponding variance components. When managed (fixed) environments are considered, users will have more confidence in prediction for them but will not be overconfident in prediction in the target (random) environments. Genetic gain (predicted response to selection in the target environments from the managed environments) is independent of formulation.},

To clarify these issues, a field and laboratory experiment was conducted on two Mediterranean legume species, Lotus ornithopodioides L. and Scorpiurus muricatus L. subsp. subvillosus (L.) Thell. [syn. Scorpiurus muricatus L. var. subvillosus (L.) Lam.]. Pods were collected from mother plants at regular intervals from the beginning of seed filling to complete maturation. The seeds harvested at different times were weighed and submitted to germination assays to evaluate their germination ability. The results show that the seeds of L. ornithopodioides and S. muricatus acquired a good germination ability ($\backslash$textgreater70\%) already at 27 and 23 d after anthesis (DAA) before reaching their maximum dry weight, while seed coat dormancy was imposed much later for the two species, at 40 and 32 DAA. Based on pod and seed morphology, seed weight, and germination ability, three distinct stages were defined during maturation, which might help identify when seeds achieve their maximum germination ability. This may be a first step in overcoming the problem of seed coat dormancy alongside studies on postharvest treatment of freshly harvested seeds.},

  abstract = {Fire is a common phenomenon in the Mediterranean environment and strongly influences vegetal population dynamics through its impact on vegetation and the soil seed bank. Fire is able to break down the seed coat of hard-seeded legumes within the soil and trigger germination. To evaluate the effect of fire on the dormancy break in Medicago ciliaris, Medicago rugosa and Scorpiurus muricatus subsp. subvillosus, the seeds were placed at three different depths (surface, 25 mm and 50 mm) and subjected to fires at two different intensities (high and low). As a control sample, a batch of seeds was buried at 25 mm for the duration of the trial and not subjected to fire. Soil temperatures during the fire were compared directly to stubble quantity and indirectly related to soil depth. The two Medicago species survived exposure to 90$^\circ$C for a few minutes and displayed a significant increase in germination with exposure to high temperatures (over 70$^\circ$C) for several minutes. On the other hand, no germination occurred in Scorpiurus, irrespective of treatment. In conclusion, fire had a significant and positive effect in triggering germination of the Medicago species, but the dispersal strategies of these hard-seeded legumes are only partially interrupted by fire as a large number of seeds ($>$50\%) remained non-germinated in the soil.},

  volume = {22},
  abstract = {Abstract The establishment of exotic generalist predators raises concerns about possible domination of the invaded community and displacement of native species. In this respect, recent studies suggest that specialists are likely to be more at risk of niche displacement than generalists, thereby compromising biological control in agroecosystems. Under laboratory conditions, we examined the susceptibility of a specialized myrmecophilous ladybird, Platynaspis luteorubra Goeze, as intraguild (IG) prey of generalist native (Oenopia conglobata L., Adalia bipunctata L.) and exotic (Harmonia axyridis Pallas) coccinellid species. We described parameters of predatory behaviour (e.g., attack rate and effectiveness of antipredator defence) and their variation among predators. Furthermore, we estimated the effect of these parameters on the time to predation using a Cox proportional hazards model. We found that A. bipunctata was the most effective IG predator of P. luteorubra, with the highest rate of successful attacks; however, P. luteorubra was not very susceptibile to attack by O. conglobata or H. axyridis, and these species exhibited lower rates of successful attack and predation. Our results, together with field observations, suggest that intraguild predation (IGP) is a factor that fosters niche specialization in P. luteorubra and decreases the realized niche of this species in central Italy. Furthermore the lower susceptibility of P. luteorubra to H. axyridis may be due to a lack of historical co-occurrence between preimmaginal stages, possibly arising from differental selection of oviposition sites.},

  title = {Toward {{Evidence}}-{{Based Medical Statistics}}. 1: {{The P Value Fallacy}}},
  volume = {130},
  abstract = {An important problem exists in the interpretation of modern medical research data: Biological understanding and previous research play little formal role in the interpretation of quantitative results. This phenomenon is manifest in the discussion sections of research articles and ultimately can affect the reliability of conclusions. The standard statistical approach has created this situation by promoting the illusion that conclusions can be produced with certain "error rates," without consideration of information from outside the experiment. This statistical approach, the key components of which are P values and hypothesis tests, is widely perceived as a mathematically coherent approach to inference. There is little appreciation in the medical community that the methodology is an amalgam of incompatible elements, whose utility for scientific inference has been the subject of intense debate among statisticians for almost 70 years. This article introduces some of the key elements of that debate and traces the appeal and adverse impact of this methodology to the P value fallacy, the mistaken idea that a single number can capture both the long-run outcomes of an experiment and the evidential meaning of a single result. This argument is made as a prelude to the suggestion that another measure of evidence should be used--the Bayes factor, which properly separates issues of long-run behavior from evidential strength and allows the integration of background knowledge with statistical findings.},

  volume = {81},
  abstract = {Many agronomic experiments with complete factorial treatment designs are conducted in two or more environments. If at least one of the treatment factors is qualitative, the combined analysis may appropriately include pairwise comparisons of various treatment means averaged over environments. Heretofore, however, formulae for estimation of the variances of pairwise mean differences, which are needed for the calculation of least significant differences (or other mean separation procedures), have not been available in either the agronomic or statistical literature. The main purpose of this paper is to provide the formulae for estimation of these variances so that researchers can use them in testing the significance of differences among various treatment means averaged over environments. Emphasis is given to combined analyses of series of experiments in which the effects of experiments are considered to be random; individual experiments are assumed to have complete factorial treatment designs involving either two or three factors of which at least one is qualitative. All treatment effects, including main effects and interactions, are considered to be fixed effects. Formulae applicable to commonly used experimental designs are presented for the estimation of variances for the five categories of pairprise mean differences in two-factor treatment designs and the 19 categories of pairwise mean differences in three-factor treatment designs. Experimental design considerations and the implications of assuming random (versus fixed) experiment effects as well as the structure of the treatment x experiment interactions are studied. Pooling portions of the treatment x experiment interaction with error mean squares are considered, and suggestions are given for cases where some of the treatment factors are quantitative rather than qualitative.},

  abstract = {Several statistical models can be used for assessing genotype 3 environment interaction (GEI) and studying genotypic stability. The objectives of this research were to show how (i) to use Bayesian meth- odology for computing Shukla's phenotypic stability variance and (ii) to incorporate prior information on the parameters for better estima- tion. Potato [Solanum tuberosum subsp. andigenum (Juz. \& Bukasov) Hawkes], wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and maize (Zea mays L.) multi environment trials (MET) were used for illustrating the ap- plication of the Bayes paradigm. The potato trial included 15 geno- types, but prior information for just three genotypes was used. The wheat trial used prior information on all 10 genotypes included in the trial, whereas for the maize trial, noninformative priors for the nine genotypes was used. Concerning the posterior distribution of the ge- notypic means, the maize MET with 20 sites gave less disperse pos- terior distributions of the genotypic means than did the posterior distribution of the genotypic means of the other METs, which included fewer environments. The Bayesian approach allows use of other sta- tistical strategies such as the normal truncated distribution (used in this study). When analyzing grain yield, a lower bound of zero and an up- per bound set by the researcher's experience can be used. The Bayes- ian paradigm offers plant breeders the possibility of computing the probability of a genotype being the best performer. The results of this study show that although some genotypes may have a very low prob- ability of being the best in all sites, they have a relatively good chance of being among the five highest yielding genotypes.},

The purpose of this research was to construct and apply a statistical method capable of producing probabilistic inferences about future yielding ability from a sample of cultivar performance trials (CPTs). Our database was CPTs of fall- and spring-planted wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the U.S. Great Plains. The mean yield of selected check cultivars that were common to a set of trials established the standard level of performance for each trial in that set. Differences in yields between other cultivars and the trial standard provided the differential yielding ability (DYA) values for those cultivars in that trial. Cultivars were judged by their performance in relation to check cultivars in a sample composed of trials from multiple locations over multiple seasons within an ecogeographic region. We assumed that environmental effects were random from trial to trial and DYA values were normally and independently distributed. This led to use of Student's t distribution for probabilistic inference about population mean DYA values. We applied our method to elite trials in several regions in our database. For each cultivar, we showed its mean DYA, standard error, and p value when testing the null hypothesis. The method can be applied to advancing generations of experimental lines in breeding trials as well as recommending late generations for release as new cultivars.},

  volume = {14},
  abstract = {The adaptation of barley varieties was studied by the use of grain yields of a randomly chosen group of 277 varieties from a world collection, grown in replicated trials for several seasons at three sites in South Australia. For each variety a linear regression of yield on the mean yield of all varieties for each site and season was computed to measure variety adaptation. In these calculations the basic yields were measured on a logarithmic scale, as it was found that a high degree of linearity was thereby induced. The mean yield of all varieties for each site and season provided a quantitative grading of the environments; and from the analysis described, varieties specifically adapted to good or poor seasons and those showing general adaptability may be identified. The study of the adaptation of the whole population of varieties was facilitated by the use of a two-dimensional plot (scatter diagram), with mean yield and regression coefficient as coordinates for each variety. Though wide variation was evident in both mean yield and sensitivity to environment as characterized by the regression coefficient, the variation in sensitivity was proportionately less among varieties with higher mean yield, and the varieties with highest mean yield exhibited, within very narrow limits (regression coefficients close to 0.8), a similar degree of adaptation to all environments over the wide range, especially of seasonal conditions, typical of the South Australian cereal belt. Varieties from particular geographic regions of the world showed a similarity in type of adaptation, which provides a useful basis for plant introduction. Phenotypic stability and physiological and morphological characteristics of groups of varieties with specific or general adaptability are discussed in relation to plant introduction and breeding.},

Stability was evaluated for a set of eight cultivars grown in 15 environments in north-eastern Austria. Five stability parameters, covering a wide range of statistical approaches, were used to describe the cultivars. There was variability for stability of quality in the set of cultivars. Some cultivars were stable for one trait and unstable for another, suggesting that the genetic factors involved in genotype by environment interactions differed between traits. It was possible to identify a check cultivar which was stable for almost all quality traits. The absolute performance of the cultivars was considered by calculating the reliability of each cultivar as a safety first index. It is demonstrated that quality wheats of Austrian origin show high performance for all quality traits except for degree of softening and Hagberg falling number.},

The program also computes Type 4 stability, superiority measure (Pi), the desirability index of genotype performance, and the pairwise genotype x environment (G x E) interaction of genotypes with checks. It partitions the G x E interaction into that due to heterogeneity of variances and that due to imperfect correlation between the genotype performance and performs the singular value decomposition of the G x E matrix, plotting the first two interactions' principal components.},

  abstract = {Summary.\^a\texteuro, Long-term experiments are commonly used tools in agronomy, soil science and other disciplines for comparing the effects of different treatment regimes over an extended length of time. Periodic measurements, typically annual, are taken on experimental units and are often analysed by using customary tools and models for repeated measures. These models contain nothing that accounts for the random environmental variations that typically affect all experimental units simultaneously and can alter treatment effects. This added variability can dominate that from all other sources and can adversely influence the results of a statistical analysis and interfere with its interpretation. The effect that this has on the standard repeated measures analysis is quantified by using an alternative model that allows for random variations over time. This model, however, is not useful for analysis because the random effects are confounded with fixed effects that are already in the repeated measures model. Possible solutions are reviewed and recommendations are made for improving statistical analysis and interpretation in the presence of these extra random variations.},

  abstract = {Ten durum wheat genotypes were studied in a total of 10 field trials in three different regions of Spain, associated with two latitudes (north and south) under both irrigated and rainfed conditions during the 1998 and 1999 growing seasons. Different technological and commercial quality parameters were studied: thousand kernel weight (TKW), test weight, vitreousness, ash content, protein content, pigment content and the SDS sedimentation test. The results demonstrated the strong influence of environmental conditions on the majority of quality traits in durum wheat, with growing zones, latitudes and moisture regimes showing the greatest effects. Genotypic effects were mainly observed for pigment content and SDS volume. These appear to be predominantly under genetic control. TKW and protein content were higher in Lleida in the north, probably due to the greater amount of nitrogen applied in comparison with Granada and Jerez in the south. Grain quality under the growing conditions of Lleida, however, was negatively influenced by the high percentages of ash accumulated in the grain. In general, Granada and Jerez provided an acceptable grain quality, and Jerez in particular favoured good semolina colour and higher test weights. Moisture stress increased mainly protein content and vitreousness, and reduced TKW and ash content at both latitudes. It is clear that rainfed conditions in the south offer the best opportunity for production of durum wheat of good quality.},

In Lleida and Granada, the experiments were conducted under both irrigated and rainfed conditions, while the Jerez trials were carried out only under rainfed conditions. Ten durum wheat genotypes were used in this study. Quality determinations consisted of 1000-kernel weight (TKW), test weight, vitreousness, ash content, protein content, pigment content and SDS sedimentation test. The influence of environment was predominant in determining the majority of quality traits, although pigment content and SDS volume were also genetically controlled. Environmental effects, studied by the mean of the climatic patterns influencing each trial, showed that total water input during grain filling appears to negatively affect grain quality by reducing test weight, grain vitreousness, and SDS volume, and by increasing ash content. High seasonal temperatures increased pigment content in the grain, but reduced TKW. From the correlations between quality parameters, an inverse and interesting relationship was found between protein content and SDS volume. Relationships between quality traits appear to be influenced to a certain extent by climatic conditions during grain filling and, depending on temperatures and water input during this phase, correlation coefficients can be either positive, negative or close to zero.},

  abstract = {The usual analysis of genotype \~A\textendash{} environment interaction (G \~A\textendash{} E) is based on the linear regression of genotypic performance on environmental changes (e.g., classic stability analysis). This linear model may often lead to lumping together of the non-linear responses to the whole range of environmental changes from suboptimal and super optimal conditions, thereby lowering the power of detecting G \~A\textendash{} E variation. On the other hand, the G \~A\textendash{} E is present when the magnitude of the genetic effect differs across the range of environmental conditions regardless of whether the response to environmental changes is linear or non-linear. The objectives of this study are: (i) explore the use of four commonly used non-linear functions (logistic, parabola, normal and Cauchy functions) for modeling non-linear genotypic responses to environmental changes and (ii) to investigate the difference in the magnitude of estimated genetic effects under different environmental conditions. The use of non-linear functions was illustrated through the analysis of one data set taken from barley cultivar trials in Alberta, Canada (Data A) and the examination of change in effect sizes is through the analysis another data set taken from the North America Barley Genome Mapping Project (Data B). The analysis of Data A showed that the Cauchy function captured an average of $>$40\% of total G \~A\textendash{} E variation whereas the logistic function captured less G \~A\textendash{} E variation than the linear function. The analysis of Data B showed that genotypic responses were largely linear and that strong QTL \~A\textendash{} environment interaction existed as the positions, sizes and directions of QTL detected differed in poor vs. good environments. We conclude that (i) the non-linear functions should be considered when analyzing multi-environmental trials with a wide range of environmental variation and (ii) QTL \~A\textendash{} environment interaction can arise from the difference in effect sizes across environments.},

  abstract = {Fisher argued that, for completely randomized designs, block designs and Latin square designs, his proposed randomization justified his proposed analysis of variance in that the latter gives valid estimates of experimental error even under very weak assumptions about the plot effects. In the succeeding 50 years a large number of more complicated experimental structures has been proposed and used. Randomization of these structures is rarely discussed in more than a cursory way, and its relationship with the analysis is mentioned even less frequently. Here I show that Fisher's ideas on validity and randomization may be set in a symmetry framework. Randomization is done by permuting the plot names, and that randomization procedure is used to justify the assumption of a relatively simple model for plot effects. Permutations are chosen at random from a specified permutation group. Except in the simplest cases, determination of the strata for the analysis of variance needs some knowledge of group theory. The relevant results from group theory are presented, together with some straightforward techniques which depend on them. The strata are then found for many large classes of examples, including the majority of experimental structures in current use.},

Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize [‘]best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

We exposed replicates of 49 RILs to experimentally manipulated light levels (open versus shade) in a greenhouse and measured photosynthetic light response curves, height, biomass, and reproduction. Plants were taller in the shade treatment, but we were unable to detect differences between light treatments (i.e., acclimation) in the maximal rate of photosynthesis, the light compensation point, or the quantum efficiency of photosynthesis. Genotypic selection analyses indicated that higher maximal rates of carbon assimilation and higher light compensation points (typical of sun-acclimated light curves) were favored by natural selection in both light treatments. Thus, it appears that the pattern of selection on photosynthetic parameters may not depend on light environment in this species.},

The factor analytic (FA) model is a parsimonious form used to approximate the fully unstructured form of the genetic variance-covariance matrix in the model for MET data. In this study, we demonstrate that the FA model is generally the model of best fit across a range of data sets taken from early generation trials in a breeding program. In addition, we demonstrate the superiority of the FA model in achieving the most common aim of METs, namely the selection of superior genotypes. Selection is achieved using best linear unbiased predictions (BLUPs) of cultivar effects at each environment, considered either individually or as a weighted average across environments. In practice, empirical BLUPs (E-BLUPs) of cultivar effects must be used instead of BLUPs since variance parameters in the model must be estimated rather than assumed known. While the optimal properties of minimum mean squared error of prediction (MSEP) and maximum correlation between true and predicted effects possessed by BLUPs do not hold for E-BLUPs, a simulation study shows that E-BLUPs perform well in terms of MSEP.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews some traditional and more recent methods for analyzing unreplicated experiments. Such experiments have presented a challenge to statisticians throughout their involvement in agricultural research. At Rothamsted this began in 1919, when R.A. Fisher was appointed to analyze the accumulated data from the classical field experiments. Fisher's experiences with the classicals, which had virtually no replication, must have contributed to his inclusion of replication as one of the key features of a well-designed experiment. Nevertheless, Fisher made good use of Rothamsted's data, for example in his study of the influence of rainfall on yields from the Broadbalk. He also devised the randomization test, which can be used to analyze unreplicated data. More recently, Broadbalk has also been used to study climate change and sustainability. Newer developments have been concerned to find alternatives to use, instead of blocking, to take account of the spatial variation within an experiment. The resulting methods for modeling spatial correlations have allowed experimenters to obtain more precise estimates of treatment effects\textendash{}or to decrease numbers of replicates\textendash{}and they can also provide reliable analyses of unreplicated treatments.},

  title = {Physiological Response Curve Analysis Using Nonlinear Mixed Models},
  volume = {132},
  abstract = {Abstract.Nonlinear response curves are often used to model the physiological responses of plants. These models are preferable to polynomials because the coefficients fit to the curves have biological meaning. The response curves are often generated by repeated measurements on one subject, over a range of values for the environmental variable of interest. However, the typical analysis of differences in coefficients between experimental groups does not include a repeated measures approach. This may lead to inappropriate estimation of error terms. Here, we show how to combine mixed model analysis, available in SAS, that allows for repeated observations on the same experimental unit, with nonlinear response curves. We illustrate the use of this nonlinear mixed model with a study in which two plant species were grown under contrasting light environments. We recorded light levels and net photosynthetic response on anywhere from 8 to 10 points per plant and fit a Mitscherlich model in which each plant has its own coefficients. The coefficients for the photosynthetic light-response curve for each plant were assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution in which the mean was determined by the treatment. The approach yielded biologically relevant coefficients and unbiased standard error estimates for multiple treatment comparisons.},

  abstract = {Abstract Best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) is a standard method for estimating random effects of a mixed model. This method was originally developed in animal breeding for estimation of breeding values and is now widely used in many areas of research. It does not, however, seem to have gained the same popularity in plant breeding and variety testing as it has in animal breeding. In plants, application of mixed models with random genetic effects has up until recently been mainly restricted to the estimation of genetic and non- genetic components of variance, whereas estimation of genotypic values is mostly based on a model with fixed effects. This paper reviews recent developments in the application of BLUP in plant breeding and variety testing. These include the use of pedigree information to model and exploit genetic correlation among relatives and the use of flexible variance\textendash{}covariance structures for genotype-by-environment interaction. We demonstrate that BLUP has good predictive accuracy compared to other procedures. While pedi- gree information is often included via the so-called numerator relationship matrix \dh{} A \TH{} , we stress that it is frequently straightforward to exploit the same infor- mation by a simple mixed model without explicit reference to the A-matrix.},

These differences provide the opportunity to analyze data in different ways. The objective of this paper is to develop a method for estimating the effective sample size and P value of a significance test of the difference between two means in an unreplicated large-scale trial in a commercial field. The method is based on a modification of a well-known correction for spatial autocorrelation of the data when testing the significance of the correlation coefficient between two random variables. An example, the comparison of readings taken from a yield monitor on two different days, is given to demonstrate the properties of the method.},

  abstract = {Genotype-environment interactions (GEI) are important in crop improvement if genotype ranks change across environments. Current tests for crossover (rank changing) interactions (COI) assume that effects are all fixed or all random. The objective of this study was to develop a new test for COI under the model with a mixture of fixed and random genotypic, environmental, and GEI effects. The key part of this new test is that the difference between a pair of genotypes at a random environment or the difference between a pair of environments for a random genotype involves the linear combinations (predictable functions) of both best linear unbiased estimates (BLUEs) of fixed effects and best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs) of random effects. The predictable functions are used in the same way as the usual estimable functions for the fixed effects in hypothesis testing except that the BLUPs of random effects are adjusted by accounting for the uncertainty arising from the distributions of these effects. Strategies are proposed to implement the procedure using the SAS system. The procedure was used to analyze barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and field pea (Pisum sativum L.) cultivar trials. The analyses show that treating random effects as fixed, as may happen with previous analysis procedures, results in detection of more COI than mixed- or random-effect models. Therefore, significant COI may be overemphasized when random GEI effects are treated as fixed.},

The most commonly used models are the linear model and the generalized linear model. The maximum likelihood method is often used for data analysis. However, this method may not be able to handle complicated models, especially multiple level hierarchical models. The Bayesian method partitions complicated models into simple components, each of which may be formulated analytically. Therefore, the Bayesian method is capable of handling very complicated models. The Bayesian method itself may not be more complicated than the maximum likelihood method, but the analysis is time consuming, because numerical integration involved in Bayesian analysis is almost exclusively accomplished based on Monte Carlo simulations, the so called Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Although the MCMC algorithm is intuitive and straightforward to statisticians, it may not be that simple to agricultural scientists, whose main purpose is to implement the method and interpret the results. In this review, we provide the general concept of Bayesian analysis and the MCMC algorithm in a way that can be understood by non-statisticians. We also demonstrate the implementation of the MCMC algorithm using professional software packages such as the MCMC procedure in SAS. Three datasets from agricultural experiments were analyzed to demonstrate the MCMC algorithm.},

As an example, we apply this method to oviposition preference data for butterflies in the genus Lycaeides. Using this method, we estimate the parameters that describe preference for each population, compare the preference hierarchies among populations, and explore various models that group populations that share the same preference hierarchy.},

  title = {A Semiparametric {{Bayesian}} Proportional Hazards Model for Interval Censored Data with Frailty Effects},
  volume = {9},
  abstract = {Background: Multivariate analysis of interval censored event data based on classical likelihood methods is notoriously cumbersome. Likelihood inference for models which additionally include random effects are not available at all. Developed algorithms bear problems for practical users like: matrix inversion, slow convergence, no assessment of statistical uncertainty. Methods: MCMC procedures combined with imputation are used to implement hierarchical models for interval censored data within a Bayesian framework. Results: Two examples from clinical practice demonstrate the handling of clustered interval censored event times as well as multilayer random effects for inter-institutional quality assessment. The software developed is called survBayes and is freely available at CRAN. Conclusion: The proposed software supports the solution of complex analyses in many fields of clinical epidemiology as well as health services research.},

  volume = {7},
  abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the role of genes and environment in susceptibility to breast cancer and to give an estimate of heritability in the propensity to develop the disease. To do this we applied an interdisciplinary approach, merging models developed in the field of demography and survival analysis \textemdash{} so-called frailty models \textemdash{} and models coming from quantitative genetics and epi- demiology, namely genetic models. In our study, the inferential problem was solved in a Bayesian frame- work and the numerical work was carried out using MCMC methods. We used the special information coming from twin data, particularly breast cancer data, from the Swedish Twin Register. The applica- tion of a correlated log-normal frailty model leads to a very large estimate of the population heterogeneity (sigma = 6.7), and relatively small correlations between co-twins' frailties \textemdash{} around 0.3 for monozygotic and 0.1 for dizygotic twins. Comparing three different genetic models (an ACE, an AE and an ADE model), we furthermore concluded that genetic effects would explain globally almost 30\% of the total vari- ability of propensity to breast cancer. Environmental effects would be predominant in determining breast cancer susceptibility and these effects would be pri- marily individual-specific, that is, non-shared effects. Finally, a model which includes dominance genetic effects (ADE model) is preferred for genetic and sta- tistical reasons.},

  abstract = {The genotype main effects and genotype-by-environment interaction effects (GGE) model and the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model are two common models for analysis of genotype-by-environment data. These models are frequently used by agronomists, plant breeders, geneticists and statisticians for analysis of multi-environment trials. In such trials, a set of genotypes, for example, crop cultivars, are compared across a range of environments, for example, locations. The GGE and AMMI models use singular value decomposition to partition genotype-by-environment interaction into an ordered sum of multiplicative terms. This article deals with the problem of testing the significance of these multiplicative terms in order to decide how many terms to retain in the final model. We propose parametric bootstrap methods for this problem. Models with fixed main effects, fixed multiplicative terms and random normally distributed errors are considered. Two methods are derived: a full and a simple parametric bootstrap method. These are compared with the alternatives of using approximate F-tests and cross-validation. In a simulation study based on four multi-environment trials, both bootstrap methods performed well with regard to Type I error rate and power. The simple parametric bootstrap method is particularly easy to use, since it only involves repeated sampling of standard normally distributed values. This method is recommended for selecting the number of multiplicative terms in GGE and AMMI models. The proposed methods can also be used for testing components in principal component analysis.},

This paper presents a systematic comparison, using both statistical theory and empirical investigations, while considering both current practices and best practices. Agricultural researchers using these analyses face two inevitable choices. First is the choice of a model for visualizing data. AMMI is decidedly superior, not for statistical reasons, but rather for agricultural reasons. AMMI partitions the overall variation into genotype main effects, environment main effects, and genotype x environment interactions. These three sources of variation present agricultural researchers with different challenges and opportunities, so it is best to handle them separately, while still considering all three in an integrated manner. Second is the choice of a member of a given model family for gaining predictive accuracy. AMMI, GGE, and other SVD-based model families are essentially equivalent, but best practices require model diagnosis for each individual dataset to determine which member is most predictively accurate. Making these two choices well allows researchers to extract more usable information from their data, thereby increasing efficiency and accelerating progress},

This review addresses more than 20 issues that require clarification after controversial statements and contrasting conclusions have appeared in those recent reviews. The AMMI2 mega-environment display incorporates more of the genotype main effect and captures more of the genotype x environment (GE) interaction than does GGE2, thereby displaying the which-won-where pattern more accurately for complex datasets. When the GE interaction is captured well by one principal component, the AMMI1 display of genotype nominal yields describes winning genotypes and adaptive responses more simply and clearly than the GGE2 biplot. For genotype evaluation within a single mega-environment, a simple scatterplot of mean and stability is more straightforward than the mean vs. stability view of a GGE2 biplot. Diagnosing the most predictively accurate member of a model family is vital for either AMMI or GGE, both for gaining accuracy and delineating mega-environments.},

The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of year, site, genotype, N application, and their interactions on the yield of hard red spring wheat (HRSW) and to demonstrate the application of the recently developed biplot methodology in visualizing agronomic research data. Ten HRSW cultivars were grown in five locations across three provinces from 1998 to 2000, constituting a total of 11 year-site combinations. In each environment, four levels of fertilizer N (50, 100, 150, and 200 kg ha-1) were applied. The N main effect, N x environment interaction, and N x genotype interaction were not significant. However, biplot analysis did reveal crossover N x environment interactions: Although higher N rates generally led to higher yield, the opposite was true in some environments. This was attributed to heavy Fusarium head blight (Fusarium graminearum Schwabe) and/or foliar diseases in these environments, which was exacerbated by higher N rates. The strong genotype x environment interactions were mainly associated with two cultivars that yielded well in most environments but very poorly in two environments in which Fusarium head blight was severe. This study thus highlighted the importance of Fusarium head blight resistance in HRSW production in eastern Canada. An environment x factor biplot was described for the first time, which was highly effective in revealing the interrelationship among environmental factors and in revealing the weather and soil patterns of the environments},

Genotypes were grown under an irrigation gradient and two N-fertilization levels. Grain polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, SDS sedimentation, and Mixograph analyses were evaluated. Flour protein composition was characterized using SE-HPLC. Moisture stress during grain-fill increased flour protein content. N fertilization increased flour protein content. No significant correlation was found between flour protein and PPO. Changes in protein composition were related to general increases in protein content, regardless if the result of reduced irrigation or increased fertilization rate. The percentage of monomeric proteins increased more than the polymeric proteins as flour protein increased. Similarly, SDS sedimentation volume increased as a function of protein content. As expected, subunit GluD1 5+10 was associated with larger sedimentation volume and higher dough strength in genotypes as compared to those with subunit GluD1 2+12. Biplot analyses showed that genotypes of similar protein quality and composition responded similarly to N and irrigation treatments.},

A genotype main effect plus genotype x environment interaction (GGE) biplot based on MET data allows visualizing (i) the which-won-where pattern of the MET, (ii) the interrelationship among test environments, and (iii) the ranking of genotypes based on both mean performance and stability. Correct visualization of these aspects, however, requires appropriate singular-value (SV) partitioning between the genotype and environment eigenvectors. This paper compares four SV scaling methods. Genotype-focused scaling partitions the entire SV to the genotype eigenvectors; environment-focused scaling partitions the entire SV to the environment eigenvectors; symmetrical scaling splits the SV symmetrically between the genotype and the environment eigenvectors; and equal-space scaling splits the SV such that genotype markers and environment markers take equal biplot space. It is recommended that the genotype-focused scaling be used in visualizing the interrelationship and comparison among genotypes and the environment-focused scaling be used in visualizing the interrelationship and comparison among environments. All scaling methods are equally valid in visualizing the which-won-where pattern of the MET data, but the symmetric scaling is preferred because it has all properties intermediate between the genotype- and the environment-focused scaling methods},

GGEbiplot analyzes the data and outputs the results as an image, and it also produces an interactive show of the data. It allows interactive visualization of the biplot from various perspectives.

The first type is constructed by the least squares solution of the sites regression model (SREG2), with the first two principal components as the primary and secondary effects, respectively. The second type is constructed by Man-del's solution for sites regression as the primary effect and the first principal component extracted from the regression residual as the secondary effect (SREGM+1). Results indicate that both the SREG2 biplot and the SREGM+1 biplot are equally effective in displaying the "which-won-where" pattern of the MET data, although the SREG2 biplot explains slightly more GGE variation. The SREGM+1 biplot is more desirable, however, in that it always explicitly indicates the average yield and stability of the genotypes and the discriminating ability and representativeness of the test environments},

Although the measured yield is a combined result of effects of genotype (G), environment (E), and genotype x environment interaction (GE), only G and GE are relevant to cultivar evaluation and mega-environment identification. This paper presents a GGE (i.e., G + GE) biplot, which is constructed by the first two symmetrically scaled principal components (PC1 and PC2) derived from singular value decomposition of environment-centered MET data. The GGE biplot graphically displays G plus GE of a MET in a way that facilitates visual cultivar evaluation and mega-environment identification. When applied to yield data of the 1989 through 1998 Ontario winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) performance trials, the GGE biplots clearly identified yearly winning genotypes and their winning niches. Collective analysis of the yearly biplots suggests two winter wheat mega-environments in Ontario: a minor mega-environment (eastern Ontario) and a major one (southern and western Ontario), the latter being traditionally divided into three subareas. There were frequent crossover GE interactions within the major mega-environment but the location groupings were variable across years. It therefore could not be further divided into meaningful subareas. It was revealed that in most years PC1 represents a proportional cultivar response across locations, which leads to noncrossover GE interactions, while PC2 represents a disproportional cultivar response across locations, which is responsible for any crossover GE interactions. Consequently, genotypes with large PC1 scores tend to give higher average yield, and locations with large PC1 scores and near-zero PC2 scores facilitates identification of such genotypes},

Our main conclusions are: (i) both GGE biplot analysis and AMMI analysis combine rather than separate G and GE in mega-environment analysis and genotype evaluation, (ii) the GGE biplot is superior to the AMMI1 graph in mega-environment analysis and genotype evaluation because it explains more G+GE and has the inner-product property of the biplot, (iii) the discriminating power vs. representativeness view of the GGE biplot is effective in evaluating test environments, which is not possible in AMMI analysis, and (iv) model diagnosis for each dataset is useful, but accuracy gain from model diagnosis should not be overstated.},

  abstract = {Multienvironment trials (MET) generate two types of two-way data: genotype x environment data for a target trait and genotype x trait data in individual or across environments. These data can be visually analyzed by a GGE biplot and a genotype x trait biplot, respectively. This paper describes a third type of biplot, the covariate-effect biplot, and illustrates its tandem use with the other biplots to achieve a fuller understanding of MET data. The covariate-effect biplot is generated on the basis of an explanatory trait x environment two-way table consisting of correlation coefficients between the target trait (e.g., yield) and each of the other traits in each of the environments. This biplot displays the yield-trait relations in individual environments and addresses whether and how the genotype x environment interactions (GE) for yield can be explored by indirect selection for the other traits. These other traits are treated as genetic covariables and can be replaced by other genetic covariables such as genetic markers, QTL, or genes. The biplot methodology was demonstrated by MET data of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) conducted across North America. Both the GGE biplot and the covariate-effect biplot showed that the environments fell into two (eastern vs. western) megaenvironments. The covariate-effect pattern explained 81\% of the GGE pattern, suggesting that the GE pattern for yield can be effectively explored by indirect selection for these traits. Specifically, barley yield can be improved by selecting for larger kernel weight, earlier heading, and better lodging resistance in the eastern megaenvironment. In contrast, the yield-trait relationship in the western megaenvironment was highly variable, and yield improvement can be achieved only by selecting for yield per se across environments. We suggest that the GGE biplot, the genotype x trait biplot, and the covariate-effect biplot be used jointly to better understand and more fully explore MET data},

  abstract = {Background and Aims Models based on thermal-time approaches have been a useful tool for characterizing and predicting seed germination and dormancy release in relation to time and temperature. The aims of the present work were to evaluate the relative accuracy of different thermal-time approaches for the description of germination in Lithospermum arvense and to develop an after-ripening thermal-time model for predicting seed dormancy release.Methods Seeds were dry-stored at constant temperatures of 5, 15 or 24 $^\circ$C for up to 210 d. After different storage periods, batches of 50 seeds were incubated at eight constant temperature regimes of 5, 8, 10, 13, 15, 17, 20 or 25 $^\circ$C. Experimentally obtained cumulative-germination curves were analysed using a non-linear regression procedure to obtain optimal population thermal parameters for L. arvense. Changes in these parameters were described as a function of after-ripening thermal-time and storage temperature.Key Results The most accurate approach for simulating the thermal-germination response of L. arvense was achieved by assuming a normal distribution of both base and maximum germination temperatures. The results contradict the widely accepted assumption of a single Tb value for the entire seed population. The after-ripening process was characterized by a progressive increase in the mean maximum germination temperature and a reduction in the thermal-time requirements for germination at sub-optimal temperatures.Conclusions The after-ripening thermal-time model developed here gave an acceptable description of the observed field emergence patterns, thus indicating its usefulness as a predictive tool to enhance weed management tactics.},

  volume = {41},
  abstract = {Seed germination rates (GR =inverse of time to germination) are sensitive to genetic, environmental, and physiological factors. We have compared the GR of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) seeds of cultivar T5 to those of rapidly germinating L. esculentum genotypes PI 341988 and PI 120256 over a range of water potential (psi). The influence of seed priming treatments and removal of the endosperm/testa cap enclosing the radicle tip on germination at reduced psi were also assessed. Germination time-courses at different psi's were analysed according to a model that identified a base, or minimum, psi allowing germination of a specific percentage (g) of the seed population (psib(g)), and a hydrotime constant' (thetaH) indicating the rate of progress toward germination per MPa.h. The distribution of psib(g) determined by probit analysis was characterized by a mean base psi (b) and the standard deviation in psib among seeds (sigmapsib). The three derived parameters, b, sigmapsib) and thetaH, were sufficient to predict the time-courses of germination of intact seeds at any psi. A normalized time-scale for comparing germination responses to reduced psi is introduced. The time to germination at any psi(tg(psi)) can be normalized to be equivalent to that observed in water (tg(0)) according to the equation tg(0)=[l-(psi/psib(g))]tg(psi). PI 341988 seeds were more tolerant of reduced psi and had a more rapid GR than T5 seeds due to both a lower b and a smaller thetaH. The rapid germination of PI 120256, on the other hand, could be attributed entirely to a smaller thetaH. Seed priming (6 d in -1.2 MPa polyethylene glycol 8000 solution at 20 \^A$^\circ$C followed by drying) increased GR at all psi$\backslash$textgreaterpsib(g), but did not lower the minimum psi allowing germination; i.e. priming reduced thetaH without lowering psib. Removing the endosperm/testa cap (cut seeds) markedly increased GR and lowered the mean psi required to inhibit germination by 0.7 to 0.9 MPa. However, this resulted primarily from downward adjustment in b during the incubation of cut seeds at low psi in the test solutions. The difference in b between intact and cut seeds incubated at high psi was much less (0.l MPa), indicating that at the time of radicle protrusion, the endosperm had weakened to the point where it constituted only a small mechanical barrier. In the intact seed, endosperm weakening and the downward adjustment in embryo b ceased at psi $\backslash$textless -0.6 MPa, while the reduction in thetaH associated with priming proceeded down to at least -1.2 MPa. Based on these data and on the pressure required to push the embryos from the seeds at various times after imbibition, it appears that the primary effect of priming was to shorten the time required for final endosperm weakening to occur. However, as priming increased GR even in cut seeds, priming effects on the embryo may control the rate of endosperm weakening.},

The effects of seed priming (6 d imbibition in aerated -1.2 MPa polyethylene glycol solution at 20 \^A$^\circ$C followed by redrying) and of removing the endosperm/testa cap covering the radicle on the temperature sensitivity of GRg, and the interaction of these treatments with genotypes, were also examined. GRg decreased linearly with decreasing temperature for all genotypes and seed treatments. The minimum or base temperatures for germination (Tb) varied by [\^a\textperthousand\textcurrency{}] 1 \^A$^\circ$C among the tomato lines, so genotypic differences in GRg were due to differing thermal time requirements for germination. The mean thermal time requirement [IMG]f1.gif" BORDER="0"$\backslash$textgreater for germination of T5 seeds was 22\% and 19\% greater than that of PI 341988 and PI 120256 seeds, respectively, but only 9\% greater than that of PI 174263 seeds.

Priming increased the GRg of T5 seeds to equal or exceed those of control (non-primed) seeds of the cold/salt-tolerant genotypes at any T$\backslash$textgreaterTb, but the PI lines exhibited an even greater response to priming. Times to germination within each seed lot were normally distributed on a logarithmic scale. Priming increased the variance in tg within a seed lot when compared to control seeds. However, the variation in thermal time for germination between the 10th and 90th percentiles of the seed population (thetaT(10-90)) was relatively unaffected by priming due to the reduction in [IMG]f2.gif" BORDER="0"$\backslash$textgreater in primed seeds.

  abstract = {The effect of alternating temperatures on the times taken by seeds of lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus) to germinate was investigated using a two-way temperature-gradient plate. Between 5 and 25$^\circ$C, warmer temperatures increased the rate of germination. Variation among the individual seeds in the times required for germination at different constant temperatures within this range were described well by a log-normal distribution of thermal times, accumulated above a base temperature of 1$\cdot$5$^\circ$C. Even with amplitudes as great as 20$^\circ$C, no effect of alternation per se on the thermal time required for germination was detected\textemdash{}whether the cool temperature was applied for 8 or 16 h d-1. Similarly, in alternating temperature regimes where the minimum temperature of the diurnal cycle was between 0$^\circ$C and the base temperature, the thermal times required for germination (where no thermal time accrued during the periods when temperature was below Tb) were in close agreement with those values provided by the model determined at warmer constant temperatures. However, where the minimum temperature applied was $<$ 0$^\circ$C the germination of all but the earliest germinators was delayed beyond model predictions, and more so where the sub-zero minimum temperature was applied for 16 rather than 8 h d-1. The results, therefore, contradict the view that alternation in temperature per se reduces the thermal time required for seed germination. Rather, rate of germination responds instantaneously to current temperature, but prolonged exposure to sub-zero temperatures can result in damage sufficient to delay germination when seeds are returned to regimes warmer than the base temperature.Copyright 1994, 1999 Academic Press},

  volume = {37},
  abstract = {Positive linear relationships were shown between constant temperatures and the rates of progress of germination to different percentiles, G, for single populations of each of five genotypes of chickpea (Cicer anetinum L.). The base temperature, Tb, at which the rate of germination is zero, was 0middle dot0degreesC for all germination percentiles of all genotypes. The optimum temperature, To(G), at which rate of germination is most rapid, varied between the five genotypes and also between percentiles within at least one population. Over the sub-optimal temperature range, i.e. from Tb to To(G), the distribution of thermal times within each population was normal. Consequently a single equation was applied to describe the influence of sub-optimal temperatures on rate of germination of all seeds within each population of each genotype. The precision with which optimum temperature, Tb(G), could be defined varied between populations. In each of three genotypes there was a negative linear relationship between temperature above Tb(G) and rate of germination. For all seeds within any of these three populations thermal time at supra-optimal temperatures was constant. Variation in the time taken to germinate at supra-optimal temperatures was a consequence of normal variation in the ceiling temperature, To(G)\textendash{}the temperature at or above which rate of progress to germination percentile G is zero. A new approach to defining the response of seed germination rate to temperature is proposed for use in germplasm screening programmes. In two populations final percentage germination was influenced by temperature. The optimum constant temperature for maximum final germination was between 10degreesC and 15degreesC in these populations; approximately 15degreesC cooler than the optimum temperature for rate of germination. It is suggested that laboratory tests of chickpea germination should be carried out at temperatures between 10degreesC and 15degreesC.},

  abstract = {Seed dormancy is an innate seed property that defines the environmental conditions in which the seed is able to germinate. It is determined by genetics with a substantial environmental influence which is mediated, at least in part, by the plant hormones abscisic acid and gibberellins. Not only is the dormancy status influenced by the seed maturation environment, it is also continuously changing with time following shedding in a manner determined by the ambient environment. As dormancy is present throughout the higher plants in all major climatic regions, adaptation has resulted in divergent responses to the environment. Through this adaptation, germination is timed to avoid unfavourable weather for subsequent plant establishment and reproductive growth. In this review, we present an integrated view of the evolution, molecular genetics, physiology, biochemistry, ecology and modelling of seed dormancy mechanisms and their control of germination. We argue that adaptation has taken place on a theme rather than via fundamentally different paths and identify similarities underlying the extensive diversity in the dormancy response to the environment that controls germination.},

In addition, some accessions that germinated relatively rapidly under non-stress conditions exhibited great sensitivity to both cold stress and salt stress. Across accessions, significant (P \&lt; 0.01) positive phenotypic correlations were observed between germination rate under control and cold stress (rP= 0.89), control and salt stress (rP= 0.63) and cold stress and salt stress (rP= 0.77). The results indicate that the rate of tomato seed germination under non-stress, cold- and salt-stress conditions may be controlled by the same genes (or physiological mechanisms), but additional components may be involved which affect germination rate under specific stress conditions.},

  abstract = {In fields, the timing of weed emergence flushes is mostly related to the timing and rate of seed germi- nation, which depend on soil temperature and water potential as well as soil tillage and crop sowing date. Base temperature and base water potential for seed germination are parameters required in weed dynamics models to take into account the effects of soil conditions on weed demography. Since these parameters are difficult to measure, our objective was to develop a method for estimating them from easily accessible information. Data on base temperature and base water potential for germination were collected from the literature for 28 weed species. Correlations were then searched for between these parameters and (i) the species ecological indicator values of Landolt and Ellenberg for temperature and moisture and (ii) dates of the onset and end of weed emergence based on experts' knowledge. Both base temperature and base water potential for germination were partially correlated with the species indicator values found in the literature. These correlations explained however only a small pro- portion of the variance of base temperature and water potential. In contrast, the base temperature of spring-emerging species was highly correlated with the mean soil temperature at the mean onset date of each species' spring emergence flush. Water potential for germination was higher for species requiring high base temperature. The date of spring emergence onset of a species, which can be easily assessed from experts' knowledge, can thus be used to estimate their base temperature and then their base water potential for germination.},

  doi = {10.1007/s11284-005-0059-4},
  abstract = {The germination response of 20 species from high altitude Mediterranean climates, most of them rare endemics, was studied. Our main goal was to model the germination response of a complete set of Iberian high mountain species. The effect of temperature and other parameters, such as spatial and temporal short gradients, on germination were also evaluated. Some seed features (mass and size) were also related to the germination response. Finally, we tested the effect of cold-wet stratification pretreatment when germination was low under natural conditions. Seeds were collected at four locations from 1,900 to 2,400 m a.s.l. in the Sierra de Guadarrama (Spanish Central Range) over two consecutive growing seasons (2001\^a\texteuro{}``2002) and submitted to different temperatures and a constant photoperiod of 16 h light/8 h darkness. Most plants readily germinate without treatment, reaching an optimum at relatively high temperatures in contrast to lowland Mediterranean species. Seeds seem to be physiologically prepared for rapid germination even though these plants usually face very intense summer droughts after ripening and dispersal. Germination was also highly variable among altitudes, populations and years, but results were inconsistent among species. Such flexibility could be interpreted as an efficient survival strategy for species growing under unpredictable environments, such as the Mediterranean climate. Finally cold-wet stratification increased germination capacity in five of nine dormant species, as widely reported for many arctic, boreal and alpine species. In conclusion, high mountain Mediterranean species do not differ from alpine species except that a relatively high number of species are ready to germinate without any treatment.},

  volume = {76},
  abstract = {The individual mean seed (caryopsis) mass of 34 natural populations of Leymus arenarius widely distributed in Iceland and one each from Scotland and England showed a six-fold variation. Phenotypic plasticity was a factor in the variation between populations in different environments but there was also likely to have been genetic differentiation. Heavy-seeded populations tended to come from early successional sites, where they also produced longer spikes and more seeds per spike. Individual seed mass was also very variable on spikes within populations and within spikes; lighter seeds were found consistently in the lower third of the spike and in the florets distal to the rachis in the spikelets. Germination was examined using the powerful methods of Survival Analysis. There were striking asymptotic relationships between seed mass and germination: an inverse relationship between median germination time and seed mass and a positive relationship between total germination percentage and seed mass. Samples from small-seeded populations typically achieved half the total germination of large-seeded ones, with up to ten-fold longer median germination times. Similar trends emerged from analysis of large- and small-seeded spikes within populations and large- and small-seeded florets within spikelets. Natural stands of Leymus arenarius are harvested on a large scale in Iceland for sowing in reclamation programmes to combat unstable and eroding sands. The harvest period is short and susceptible to autumn gales and grazing. Mean individual seed mass would provide a rapid and reliable measure of seed quality, in terms of rapid germination and high germination rate. Stands should not be selected for harvest unless the individual seed mass averaged for whole spikes is at least 5 mg and such stands are most likely to be found in early-successional dune sites.Copyright 1995, 1999 Academic Press},

Relative seedlot response predicted by thermal time coefficients was somewhat different from that estimated from mean field-variable temperature response as a function of subpopulation.\textbullet{}Conclusions All germination response models tested performed relatively well in estimating field-variable temperature response. IPO caused systematic errors in predictions of germination time, and may have degraded the physiological relevance of resultant cardinal-temperature parameters.

  abstract = {Background and Aims Most current thermal-germination models are parameterized with subpopulation-specific rate data, interpolated from cumulative-germination-response curves. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative accuracy of three-dimensional models for predicting cumulative germination response to temperature. Three-dimensional models are relatively more efficient to implement than two-dimensional models and can be parameterized directly with measured data. $\dottedsquare$ Methods Seeds of four rangeland grass species were germinated over the constant-temperature range of 3 to 38 $\dottedsquare$C and monitored for subpopulation variability in germination-rate response. Models for estimating subpopulation germination rate were generated as a function of temperature using three-dimensional regression, statistical gridding and iterative-probit optimization using both measured and interpolated-subpopulation data as model inputs. $\dottedsquare$ Key Results Statistical gridding is more accurate than three-dimensional regression and iterative-probit optimization for modelling germination rate and germination time as a function of temperature and subpopulation. Optimization of the iterative-probit model lowers base-temperature estimates, relative to two-dimensional cardinal-temperature models, and results in an inability to resolve optimal-temperature coefficients as a function of subpopulation. Residual model error for the three-dimensional model was extremely high when parameterized with measured-subpopulation data. Use of measured data for model evaluation provided a more realistic estimate of predictive error than did evaluation of the larger set of interpolated-subpopulation data. $\dottedsquare$ Conclusions Statistical-gridding techniques may provide a relatively efficient method for estimating germination response in situations where the primary objective is to estimate germination time. This methodology allows for direct use of germination data for model parameterization and automates the significant computational requirements of a two-dimensional piece-wise-linear model, previously shown to produce the most accurate estimates of germination time.},

  abstract = {Several models have been proposed to describe germination rates, but most are limited in statistical analysis and biological meaning of indices. Therefore, a mathematical model is proposed to utilize the logistic function. The function was defined as an overall response including time, temperature, and the interaction between time and temperature. Cumulative germination percentages over time were used to develop the model. Germination tests were conducted on indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans (L.) Nash) strain IG-2C-F1', at constant temperatures of 9, 12, 15, 20, 25, and 30 degreesC. The function fitted the observed data over six temperatures at r2 = 0.99. Time to reach 10\% of final germination (Gt10) increased from 2.5 d at 30 degreesC to 44.0 d at 9 degreesC, and Gt50 (time to reach 50\% of final germination) increased from 3.6 d at 30 degreesC to 53.8 d at 9 degreesC. True germination rate (\% d-1) for each temperature was maximum at Gt50. A linear model of 1/Gt50 versus temperature was used to estimate the base temperature of 8.3 degreesC for germination. An Arrhenius plot indicated a change occurred between 20 degreesC and 25 degreesC for temperature response of germination. Published data on hypocotyl growth of Cucumis melo L. were recalculated using the model. Absolute growth rates showed a temperature response similar to the published weighted-mean elongation rates. Base temperature for hypocotyl growth of C. melo was estimated as 8.8 degreesC. The proposed model proved to be useful in calculating and interpreting germination and growth kinetics.},

  volume = {289},
  abstract = {The direct application of existing models for seed germination may often be inadequate in the context of ecology and forestry germination experiments. This is because basic model assumptions are violated and variables available to forest managers are rarely used. In this paper, we present a method which addresses the aforementioned shortcomings. The approach is illustrated through a case study of Pinus pinea L. Our findings will also shed light on the role of germination in the general failure of natural regen- eration in managed forests of this species. The presented technique consists of a mixed regression model based on survival analysis. Climate and stand covariates were tested. Data for fitting the model were gathered from a 5-year germination experiment in a mature, managed P. pinea stand in the Northern Pla- teau of Spain in which two different stand densities can be found. The model predictions proved to be unbiased and highly accurate when compared with the training data. Germination in P. pinea was con- trolled through thermal variables at stand level. At microsite level, low densities negatively affected the probability of germination. A time-lag in the response was also detected. Overall, the proposed tech- nique provides a reliable alternative to germination modelling in ecology/forestry studies by using acces- sible/suitable variables. The P. pinea case study highlights the importance of producing unbiased predictions. In this species, the occurrence and timing of germination suggest a very different regenera- tion strategy from that understood by forest managers until now, which may explain the high failure rate of natural regeneration in managed stands. In addition, these findings provide valuable information for the management of P. pinea under climate-change conditions.},

  abstract = {The timing of seedling emergence may strongly affect fitness in competitive environments. Therefore, selection should favour mechanisms that allow sensing neighbours prior to emergence. We tested whether or not germination is affected by density and identity of neighbouring seeds or seedlings of desert perennial plants. Based on theory, we predicted that germination fractions are independent of neighbouring seeds, that germination is accelerated in dense interspecific neighbourhoods, and neighbour effects are caused by seedlings, not by seeds. We examined germination fraction and timing of four naturally coexisting sandy desert perennial species in low versus high seed densities in both intra- and interspecific neighbourhoods, and with and without removal of newly emerged seedlings. Neighbours accelerated germination independent of density and this pattern was apparently caused by the presence of early emerging seedlings. Germination fractions were lower in high seed densities even when neighbours did not germinate, indicating that seeds were able to sense each other prior to emergence. Early germination may be adaptive because fast emerging seedlings may gain a competitive edge over slow emerging ones. However, since seeds that did not germinate died, delayed germination may only be advantageous for mother plants when sib competition is intense. Another key finding was a competitive hierarchy with late successional species germinating faster and inhibiting germination of pioneer species. This indicates that successional processes may be directed as early as during germination.},

  title = {Effect of {{Canopy Position}} on {{Germination}} and {{Seedling Survival}} of {{Epiphytic Bromeliads}} in a {{Mexican Humid Montane Forest}}},
  volume = {95},
  abstract = {* Background and Aims Seeds of epiphytes must land on branches with suitable substrates and microclimates to germinate and for the resulting seedlings to survive. It is important to understand the fate of seeds and seedlings in order to model populations, but this is often neglected when only established plants are included in analyses. * Methods The seeds of five bromeliad species were exposed to different canopy positions in a Mexican montane forest, and germination and early seedling survival were recorded. Additionally, the survival of naturally dispersed seedlings was monitored in a census over 2middle dot5 years. Survival analysis, a procedure rarely used in plant ecology, was used to study the influence of branch characteristics and light on germination and seedling survival in natural and experimental populations. * Key Results Experimental germination percentages ranged from 7middle dot2 \% in Tillandsia deppeana to 33middle dot7 \% in T. juncea, but the seeds of T. multicaulis largely failed to germinate. Twenty months after exposure between 3middle dot5 and 9middle dot4 \% of the seedlings were still alive. There was no evidence that canopy position affected the probability of germination, but time to germination was shorter in less exposed canopy positions indicating that higher humidity accelerates germination. More experimental seedlings survived when canopy openness was high, whereas survival in census-seedlings was influenced by moss cover. While mortality decreased steadily with age in juveniles of the atmospheric Tillandsia, in the more mesomorphic Catopsis sessiliflora mortality increased dramatically in the dry season. * Conclusions Seedling mortality, rather than the failure to germinate, accounts for the differential distribution of epiphytes within the canopy studied. With few safe sites to germinate and high seedling mortality, changes of local climate may affect epiphyte populations primarily through their seedling stage.},

Considering pre-emergence herbicides, acetochlor and S-metolachlor alone seem not to be advisable due to their low efficacy against broadleaved weeds. Herbicide mixtures based on terbuthylazine gave the highest weed control, although thiencarbazone-methyl + isoxaflutole or s-metolachlor + mesotrione represent two valid alternatives to terbuthylazine. Post-emergence herbicides gave a good control of weeds, although mesotrione + nicosulfuron or tembotrione showed a higher efficacy than foramsulfuron. Crop yield losses in the untreated check compared to the highest yield obtained with herbicides treatments, ranging from 33\% to 91\%.},

Collectively, these long-term experiments have (a) provided unique insights into ecological patterns and processes, although such insight often became apparent only after many years of study; (b) influenced management and policy decisions; and (c) evolved into research platforms supporting studies and involving investigators who were not part of the original design. Furthermore, this suite of long-term experiments addresses, at the site level, all of the US National Research Council's Grand Challenges in Environmental Sciences. Despite these contributions, we argue that the scale and scope of global environmental change requires a more-coordinated multisite approach to long-term experiments. Ideally, such an approach would include a network of spatially extensive multifactor experiments, designed in collaboration with ecological modelers that would build on and extend the unique context provided by the LTER Network.},

  abstract = {Appropriate nitrogen management is one of the main challenges of agricultural production and for the environment. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficiency of crop N uptake in a long-term wheat crop in a Mediterranean environment of Southern Italy, and to identify optimal N rate for reasonable economic returns and minimum nitrate leaching using SALUS crop simulation model. The study was part of a long-term monoculture wheat system that started in 1991/1992 season, with two levels of nitrogen (0 and 90 kg N ha\^a\dbend{}'1). Simulations of the treatment with no nitrogen (0 N) and 90 kg N ha\^a\dbend{}'1 (90 N) were performed using the SALUS crop model for wheat. The model was tested against measurements of harvested grain yield, final N uptake, soil water content and total soil N. Long-term simulation over 56 years showed that grain yield median value was 3435 kg ha\^a\dbend{}'1 for 0 N and 3876 kg ha\^a\dbend{}'1 for 90 N. Simulation scenarios with different N rates (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 kg N ha\^a\dbend{}'1) showed that yield response was higher for 120 N (3528 kg ha\^a\dbend{}'1), with the 60 and 90 N yields giving the same response, 3010 and 3054 kg ha\^a\dbend{}'1, respectively. The most profitable treatments were 120 N (302 Euro ha\^a\dbend{}'1), followed by the 60 N (220 Euro ha\^a\dbend{}'1). The simulation results showed that nitrate leaching was higher for the N rate of 120 and 180 with a mean annual value of 49 and 81 kg ha\^a\dbend{}'1, respectively. Results suggest that in such environment 60 kg N ha\^a\dbend{}'1 can be the most appropriate as an N fertilization management due to the best trade-off between leaching and economic. Since N fertilization rates are linked to nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and N leaching, a trade-off between N fertilization rates profit and grain yield should be thought as way to reduce environmental pollution while keeping productivity and profit. The adoption of simulation models to approximate the best N rate for durum wheat in rainfed Mediterranean environment proved to be a useful tool for supporting management decisions through quantifying the temporal variability related to weather uncertainty as it influences on the yield and nutrient dynamics.},

The current study used a molecular method to quantify soil G. graminis var. tritici concentrations in commercial wheat fields in New Zealand and to compare them with the proportion of crops surpassing the thresholds for visible and moderate to severe take-all over three growing seasons. The study evaluated a soil G. graminis var. tritici DNA-based take-all prediction system developed in Australia, with four take-all risk categories. These categories were found to be useful for predicting disease severity in second wheat but did not clearly separate risk between fields in medium- and high-risk categories. A sigmoidal relationship was identified between inoculum concentration and the proportion of fields exceeding the two disease thresholds. A logistic response curve was used to further examine this relationship and evaluate the boundaries between take-all risk categories. G. graminis var. tritici boundaries between medium- and high-risk categories were clustered near or within the upper plateau of the relationship. Alternative G. graminis var. tritici boundaries for a three-category system were identified that provided better separation of take-all risk between categories. This information could improve prediction of the risk of severe take-all.},

All residues were incorporated and the treatments were: straw (N0), straw with fall burn (N0FB), straw with spring burn (N0SB), straw plus 45 kg N ha\^a\dbend{}'1 (N45), straw plus 90 kg N ha\^a\dbend{}'1 (N90), straw burned in spring plus 45 kg N ha\^a\dbend{}'1 (N45SB), straw burned in spring plus 90 kg N ha\^a\dbend{}'1 (N90SB), straw plus 2.24 T ha\^a\dbend{}'1 pea-vine residue and straw plus 22.4 T ha\^a\dbend{}'1 of straw-manure. Enzyme activities were significantly (P$\backslash$textless0.001) affected by residue management. The highest activities were observed in the manure treated soil, ranging from 36\% (acid phosphatase) to 190\% increase in activity over the control (N0). The lowest activities occurred in the N0FB (acid phosphatase, arylsulfatase and \^I$\backslash$textsuperscript2-glucosidase) and N90 treated soils (alkaline phosphatase, amidase and urease). Straw-burning had a significant effect only on acid phosphatase activity, which decreased in spring burn treated soil when inorganic N was applied. Urease and amidase activity decreased with long-term addition of inorganic N whereas the pea vine and the manure additions increased urease and amidase activity. There was a highly significant effect from the residue treatments on soil pH. Arylsulfatase, urease, amidase and alkaline phosphatase activities were positively correlated and acid phosphatase activity was negatively correlated with soil pH. Enzyme activities were strongly correlated with soil organic C and total N content. Except for acid phosphatase, there was no significant relationship between enzyme activity and grain yield.},

  abstract = {Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were used to \^a\dbend\dbend{}fingerprint\^a\dbend\dbend{} soil microbial communities that evolved during 25 years of wheat-fallow cropping following native mixed prairie sod at Sidney, Nebraska, USA. Total ester-linked FAMEs (EL-FAMEs) and phospholipid-linked FAMEs (PL-FAMEs) were compared for their ability to discriminate between plots remaining in sod and those cropped to wheat or left fallow under no-till, sub-till or plow management. Cropped plots were higher in microbial biomass than their fallowed counterparts, and did not differ significantly with tillage for the 0\^a\dbend{}``15 cm depth. Under fallow, microbial biomass was greatest in no-till and least in plow. Both cluster and discriminant analysis of PL- and EL-FAMEs clearly separated the remaining native sod plots from the existing wheat-fallow plots. This separation was particularly pronounced for the EL-FAMEs and was largely driven by high amounts in sod of a single FAME, C16:1(cis11), which has been cited as a biomarker for arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Within wheat-fallow, C16:1(cis11) declined significantly from no-till to plow, which supports the origin of C16:1(cis11) from extraradical mycelium and spores of AM fungi known to be sensitive to soil disturbance. Although discriminant analysis of PL- and EL-FAMEs differentiated wheat and fallow systems by tillage, discrimination among tillage treatments was expressed most strongly during fallow. FAME profiles from fallow plow were most dissimilar from cropped soils which suggests a relationship between tillage management and the long-term resiliency of the microbial community developed under the wheat crop.},

  doi = {10.4141/cjss87-081},
  abstract = {Soil from a long-term crop rotation study conducted at Lethbridge, Alberta was analyzed to determine the influence of various spring wheat rotations with and without perennial forages on total and mineralizable soil organic matter contents. Crop rotations considered included: continuous wheat (W), fallow-wheat (FW), fallow-wheat-wheat (FWW), and fallow-wheat-wheat-forage-forage-forage (FWWAAA) in which the forage was a mixture of alfalfa and crested wheat grass. The organic C and N contents of soil after 33\^a\dbend\dbend{}yr of cropping were highest in treatments W and FWWAAA, and decreased with increasing frequency of fallow in the rotation. The inclusion of the perennial forage in the rotation did not increase organic C and N levels above those observed in the continuous wheat treatment (W). Differences in levels of mineralizable organic matter among treatments, as measured in laboratory incubations, were much greater than differences in total organic matter content among treatments. In the surface soil layer (0\^a\dbend{}``15\^a\dbend\dbend{}cm), N mineralization was significantly higher in treatment W than in treatments FWW and FWWAAA, and was more than twice that observed in treatment FW. In the subsurface soil layer (15\^a\dbend{}``30\^a\dbend\dbend{}cm), N mineralization was greatest in treatment FWWAAA when sampled just after the plowdown of forage. Effects of crop rotation on C mineralization were similar to those observed for N. Levels of mineralized organic matter were closely related to levels of "light fraction" material (specific gravity $\backslash$textless\^a\dbend\dbend{}1.59\^a\dbend\dbend{}g cm\^a\dbend{}'3), which is believed to consist primarily of incompletely decomposed organic matter of plant origin. Differences in amounts of mineralizable organic matter among treatments were attributed to varying frequencies and patterns of crop residue additions. The pronounced effects of crop rotation on the distribution of organic matter among labile and humified organic matter will have a strong impact on soil fertility and may need to be taken into consideration in the development of fertilizer recommendations. It was concluded that inclusion of perennial forages in spring wheat rotations for the purpose of enhancing soil fertility and organic matter levels was not justified under semiarid conditions.

Three types of design are distinguished and their properties considered. These are basic designs with all phases of the rotations in each block, reduced designs with mutually exclusive groups of phases kept in separate blocks and phase-confounded designs in which some contrasts between test crops are partially confounded with block differences. Methods of analysing the yields of test crops by estimating the mean effects of the rotations over the years and regressions on seasonal and time variates are discussed theoretically for replicated experiments of basic or reduced design. The analysis is complicated by correlations between yield values recurring on the same plots and by lack of homogeneity in residual year-to-year variations in rotation effects. The main topics considered are (1) the estimation of errors, (2) the losses of information due to using unweighted means and regressions ignoring the correlations, (3) methods for recovering this information.},

  abstract = {Nine soil organic models were evaluated using twelve datasets from seven long-term experiments. Datasets represented three different land-uses (grassland, arable cropping and woodland) and a range of climatic conditions within the temperate region. Different treatments (inorganic fertilizer, organic manures and different rotations) at the same site allowed the effects of differing land management to be explored. Model simulations were evaluated against the measured data and the performance of the models was compared both qualitatively and quantitatively. Not all models were able to simulate all datasets; only four attempted all. No one model performed better than all others across all datasets. The performance of each model in simulating each dataset is discussed. A comparison of the overall performance of models across all datasets reveals that the model errors of one group of models (RothC, CANDY, DNDC, CENTURY, DAISY and NCSOIL) did not differ significantly from each other. Another group (SOMM, ITE and Verberne) did not differ significantly from each other but showed significantly larger model errors than did models in the first group. Possible reasons for differences in model performance are discussed in detail.},

One rational and cost-effective method may be the implementation of increased agricultural crop diversification. Crop diversification can improve resilience in a variety of ways: by engendering a greater ability to suppress pest outbreaks and dampen pathogen transmission, which may worsen under future climate scenarios, as well as by buffering crop production from the effects of greater climate variability and extreme events. Such benefits point toward the obvious value of adopting crop diversification to improve resilience, yet adoption has been slow. Economic incentives encouraging production of a select few crops, the push for biotechnology strategies, and the belief that monocultures are more productive than diversified systems have been hindrances in promoting this strategy. However, crop diversification can be implemented in a variety of forms and at a variety of scales, allowing farmers to choose a strategy that both increases resilience and provides economic benefits.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive review of literature related to the assessment of climate change impacts on crop productivity using climate, water and crop yield models. The existing studies present that climate change models with higher spatial resolution can be a way forward for future climate projections. Meanwhile, stochastic projections of more than one climate model are necessary for providing insights into model uncertainties as well as to develop risk management strategies. It is projected that water availability will increase in some parts of the world, which will have its own effect on water use efficiency and water allocation. Crop production can increase if irrigated areas are expanded or irrigation is intensified, but these may increase the rate of environmental degradation. Since climate change impacts on soil water balance will lead to changes of soil evaporation and plant transpiration, consequently, the crop growth period may shorten in the future impacting on water productivity. Crop yields affected by climate change are projected to be different in various areas, in some areas crop yields will increase, and for other areas it will decrease depending on the latitude of the area and irrigation application. Existing modelling results show that an increase in precipitation will increase crop yield, and what is more, crop yield is more sensitive to the precipitation than temperature. If water availability is reduced in the future, soils of high water holding capacity will be better to reduce the impact of drought while maintaining crop yield. With the temperature increasing and precipitation fluctuations, water availability and crop production are likely to decrease in the future. If the irrigated areas are expanded, the total crop production will increase; however, food and environmental quality may degrade.},

  abstract = {Advances in statistical software allow statistical methods for nonlinear regression analysis of dose-response curves to be carried out conveniently by non-statisticians. One such statistical software is the program R with the drc extension package. The drc package can: (1) simultaneously fit multiple dose-response curves; (2) compare curve parameters for significant differences; (3) calculate any point along the curve at the response level of interest, commonly known as an effective dose (e.g., ED30, ED50, ED90), and determine its significance; and (4) generate graphs for publications or presentations. We believe that the drc package has advantages that include: the ability to relatively simply and quickly compare multiple curves and select ED-levels easily along the curve with relevant statistics; the package is free of charge and does not require licensing fees, and the size of the package is only 70 MB. Therefore, our objectives are to: (1) provide a review of a few common issues in dose-response-curve fitting, and (2) facilitate the use of up-to-date statistical techniques for analysis of dose-response curves with this software. The methods described can be utilized to evaluate chemical and non-chemical weed control options. Benefits to the practitioners and academics are also presented.},

  abstract = {The log-logistic model is a popular candidate for modeling dose response in agronomy. One of its limitations is monotonicity: the response is either continuously increasing or decreasing with changes in dosage. In herbicide dose response investigations, authors have previously noted an increase in biomass or growth for subinhibitory dosages. This hormetic effect, if ignored, can lead to substantial bias in estimates of effective dosages and can distort inferences about the differential effects of experimental treatments. We present an extension of a model capable of modeling hormetic effects that allows inference about effective dosages. Furthermore, the model can be used to compare effective dosages among different treatments if hormetic effects are present for some and absent for others and provides appropriate estimates of rates of change. In a designed experiment where velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medikus) and barnyardgrass [Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P. Beauv.] were treated with glyphosate [isopropylamine salt of N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine] + (NH4)2SO4 or glufosinate [2-amino-4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)butanoic acid] + (NH4)2SO4 at various rates, hormetic effects were found for barnyardgrass treated with glyphosate but not with glufosinate. Procedures for a valid comparison of effective dosages between the two herbicides are presented. Software code to perform the analyses is given in an appendix.},

Under the assumption of similarity of response curves and by incorporating a function that can model the shape of isoboles, we can statistically test whether divergence from the Additive Dose Model (ADM) is significant. Two dose-response experiments with mixtures of either salt or ester formulations of MCPA and mecoprop-P and one experiment with tribenuron-methyl and mecoprop-P were analysed. Mixtures of tribenuron-methyl and a salt formulation of mecoprop-P showed antagonism. Mixtures of salt formulations of MCPA and mecoprop-P followed ADM, whilst ester formulations of the same compounds showed synergism. To get reliable estimates, the model requires mixture ratios covering the whole isobole \textcopyright{} 1998 SCI},

  volume = {26},
  abstract = {Abstract. The use of generalized linear models (GLM) for relating changes in insect behaviour to changes in the chemical composition of a plant extract is presented and applied to data from an experimental study of the olfactory response of Cydia pomonella L. (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) to apple volatiles. The volatiles were collected from healthy apples, artificially damaged apples or apples infested with C. pomonella larvae (either instar I, IV or V). These treatments produced a blend of 23 major components and the chemical composition of the blends differed substantially amongst the treatments. A statistically significant relationship was found between the concentration of hexyl hexanoate and 2-methylbutyl acetate in each extract and the number of moths moving upwind. Statistically significant models were developed which suggested that a relationship exists between the concentration of Z,E-\&agr;-farnesene, hexyl hexanoate and 2-methylbutyl acetate and the number and duration of movements made by the moths. Subsequently Y-tube assays were carried out to validate the predictions made with respect to the orientation of mated female C. pomonella. The results of these assays confirm hexyl hexanoate as an attractant. There were indications that 2-methylbutyl acetate acted as a repellent although differences were not statistically significant. Previous bioassays have shown that C. pomonella displays a statistically significant negative linear dose\textendash{}response to \&agr;-farnesene (Hern \& Dorn, 1999). The statistical methods employed are very flexible and fairly easy to implement, offering the potential to screen plant extracts for bioactive compounds with a minimum of biological constraints. Their general applicability has yet to be demonstrated and as such these analyses only offer evidence of statistical relationships; the results must be validated by additional bioassays before conclusions can be drawn.},

Considerable variability in the ratio of dry weight produced per unit of transpired water, usually referred to as water-use efficiency (WUE), is expected as variation in climatic factors affects photosynthesis and transpiration in different ways. Also, previous studies have shown that water supply limitations may affect WUE in wheat. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of climatic environment and water availability on WUE in wheat crops. Six experiments were conducted at different locations of the Argentine wheat belt and crop dry weight and water use were measured in periods when water use was dominated by transpiration. Three of the experiments included both irrigated and rainfed treatments. Mean daily values of (i) pan evaporation, (ii) relative humidity, (iii) potential water use, and (iv) vapor pressure deficit, were used to find a general relationship that explained effects of the climatic environment on WUE. For experiments with high water availability, daytime vapor pressure deficit was better related to WUE than the other climatic factors. WUE was greater for experiments with water limitation, probably because stomatal closure to restrict transpiration rate occurred around midday when vapor pressure deficit was highest. As a consequence, relative dry weight under water limitation was not linearly related to relative water use as proposed in previous studies. A quadratic relationship that better represented this response was derived.},

  volume = {29},
  abstract = {The rates of net photosynthesis per unit ground area by a closed canopy of tomato plants were measured over a range of natural light flux densities. The canopy, of leaf area index 8.6, was divided into three horizontal layers of equal depth. On successive days the canopy was progressively defoliated in layers from the ground upwards, allowing the photosynthetic contribution from individual leaf layers to be determined. The uppermost layer, 23\% of the total leaf area, assimilated 66\% of the net CO2 fixed by the canopy and accounted for a similar percentage of the total leaf respiration. Net photosynthesis versus light response curves for individual leaves from different positions within the canopy were also obtained. Leaf conductances to CO2 transfer and the dark respiration rates of leaves from the uppermost leaf layer were approximately ten times those from the lowest layer. The canopy data were analysed using a simple model which assumed that the canopy was composed of leaves with identical photosynthetic and respiratory characteristics. The model fitted the data and allowed the characteristics of an idealized' leaf to be estimated. The estimated values of the leaf light utilization efficiency, alpha,and the leaf conductance CO2 transfer, tau, were similar to values directly determined for individual leaves in the uppermost leaf layer and the estimated rate of leaf dark respiration, Rd, corresponded to measured rates for leaves much lower in the canopy. The simple model may be used to examine gross effects of crop environment on the leaf photosynthetic characteristic of an idealized' leaf, but cannot be used to predict accurately canopy net photosynthesis from the photosynthetic and respiratory characteristics of any single real leaf. A more detailed model, developed to allow explicitly for the observed variation in tau and Rd within the canopy is appropriate for this purpose.},

  issn = {0304-3800},
  abstract = {Object-oriented design (OOD) and programming (OOP) offer many advantages for developing modular crop models. The model structure is well-defined, reuse of code is facilitated through inheritance, and data can be hidden (encapsulated) inside objects that correspond to physical components of the real system, e.g. roots, stems, leaves, or soil layers. However, OOD is best suited to describing the relationship between freely interacting objects, and it has so far been used almost exclusively for modeling simple, discrete and sequential actions. Plant models are not like the automatic teller machine software that is often used in examples of OOD. Plant organs, i.e. objects on the plant, do not wait passively for input from other organs, but they all grow in response to their environment and interact with each other simultaneously and continuously. Also, our ignorance of the processes controlling plant growth forces us to use devices like the limiting factor model to handle these interactions. Many plant models therefore calculate potential growth, limitations imposed by various factors, and then actual growth. In short, there are procedural elements in plant models that do not easily fit an OOD. However, some OOP languages like C+ + allow mixed designs to be implemented, so we have developed a mixed, but mostly object-oriented structure that (1) contains the components familiar in extant procedural designs; (2) can be used for modeling at several levels of complexity; and (3) can be used to model any plant. The mixed procedural/object-oriented design has been implemented in C+ + as a shell using dummy algorithms, and its operation verified. The problems and advantages are discussed.},

  abstract = {stics is a model that has been developed at INRA (France) since 1996. It simulates crop growth as well as soil water and nitrogen balances driven by daily climatic data. It calculates both agricultural variables (yield, input consumption) and environmental variables (water and nitrogen losses). From a conceptual point of view, stics relies essentially on well-known relationships or on simplifications of existing models. One of the key elements of stics is its adaptability to various crops. This is achieved by the use of generic parameters relevant for most crops and on options in the model formalisations concerning both physiology and management, that have to be chosen for each crop. All the users of the model form a group that participates in making the model and the software evolve, because stics is not a fixed model but rather an interactive modelling platform. This article presents version 5.0 by giving details on the model formalisations concerning shoot ecophysiology, soil functioning in interaction with roots, and relationships between crop management and the soil\~A\textcent\_"crop system. The data required to run the model relate to climate, soil (water and nitrogen initial profiles and permanent soil features) and crop management. The species and varietal parameters are provided by the specialists of each species. The data required to validate the model relate to the agronomic or environmental outputs at the end of the cropping season. Some examples of validation and application are given, demonstrating the generality of the stics model and its ability to adapt to a wide range of agro-environmental issues. Finally, the conceptual limits of the model are discussed.},

  volume = {56},
  abstract = {Vegetable crops such as processing tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) are usually complex in terms of nitrogen (N) dynamics because of the large amounts absorbed by the crop, the short growing season and the use of irrigation. Complexity increases when N is supplied from an organic source. A crop simulation model could be very useful to improve N management in this crop. Processing tomatoes were grown on raised beds and furrow irrigated in 1994 and 1995 in the Sacramento Valley of California. Fertilizer N and/or purple vetch (Vicia sativa L.) as green manure and composted turkey manure were used as sources of N. The Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC) model was calibrated with 1994 data and validated with 1995 data. Plant growth was accurately simulated in the conventional systems that used fertilizer N and in the low input system that used fertilizer N plus vetch. The model accurately simulated above-ground biomass in a system that used vetch and no synthetic fertilizer N, but it over-predicted Leaf Area Index (LAI). Nitrogen deficiency was observed in the plants in this system. The model simulated nitrogen deficiency mainly as a reduction in biomass production but in the real world the reduction of leaf area was the first effect of nitrogen deficiency in the vegetative phase. Yields were accurately predicted except when diseases affected plant growth. A simple reduction factor of nitrate movement in the bed adequately addressed the movement of nitrate. In general, the model accurately predicted the evolution of inorganic nitrogen in different soil layers during the crop season. However, simulated inorganic N in the upper 15 cm was underestimated in the last part of the crop season and consequently N uptake at harvest was slightly over-predicted in some cases. Nitrogen distribution and access of the roots to inorganic nitrogen are discussed as causes of this discrepancy between model simulated and observed values.},

  volume = {21},

  abstract = {This work stems from the need to set-up appropriate simulation models for scenario analysis of intensive forage cropping systems in northern Italy, where alfalfa plays a major role. CropSyst is a deterministic, process-based, with daily time-step cropping systems simulation model. It can simulate crop growth and development, water and nitrogen balance for herbaceous annual and perennial crops. In this work, it was used to simulate aboveground biomass (AGB) accumulation and soil water content (SWC) for two alfalfa meadows seeded in 1996 and 1997 in Lodi, northern Italy (45\~A,\^A$^\circ$N latitude). The crop was parameterised with data from the literature, local experience and calibration with measured data from the first 2 years. Data from the third year were used for validation.The cumulative yields of the 3-year periods were 38.2 and 36.9tAGBha\~A\textcent\textasciicircum{}'1, obtained with a total of 14 cuts. The set of crop parameters is consistent with values reported in the literature. For most of the cuts, the model simulates appropriately the growth of the crop: the relative root mean squared error (RRMSE) between observed and measured AGB ranged between 3 and 6\% after calibration and between 3 and 5\% after validation. RRMSE for SWC ranged between 13 and 21\% after calibration and between 10 and 20\% after validation. Even if some limitations are explicitly addressed, this crop parameter set can be already used for explorative scenario simulations in the study area. This work has demonstrated the robustness of the model for perennial forage crops simulations and has suggested some improvements of the model (automatic scheduling of cuts, role of crown reserves).},

  volume = {96},
  abstract = {The evaluation of patterns in the residuals of model estimates vs. other variables can be useful in both model evaluation and parameter calibration. New indices that allow quantifying such patterns (pattern indices) are presented. Groups of residuals are created by dividing the range of the variable under evaluation into two, three, four, or five subranges. Two types of indices are proposed. The first type (PI-type) is based on the absolute value of the maximum difference between pairwise comparisons among average residuals of each group of residuals. A variant of this index is computed by using variance ratios (PI-F type). The subranges of the variable that determines the grouping of residuals may be of equal length (PI) or variable length (PInu). In the second case, they are generated by an algorithm that optimizes subranges to maximize patterns. The power of the diverse pattern indices at identifying patterns was investigated, and their effectiveness was compared against the runs test. Critical values for pattern indices were generated by Monte Carlo simulations. Monte Carlo probability tables, the results of power analysis, and the results of using pattern indices at two case studies (i.e., daily radiation and soil water content estimates) were presented. The analysis based on pattern indices provided insight in model structure and parameter calibration. Pattern indices also allowed evaluating model performance and discriminating among alternative models. Higher power in identifying patterns was given by range-based pattern indices than by those based on variance ratios.},

Experimental data collected from rotation experiments during the period 1985-91 were used to calibrate and validate the model. The data set available was not detailed enough to test most of the sub-models, but it was adequate for a satisfactory test of overall model performance. Simulations were conducted for 6-year rotations providing initial conditions of the first year without reinitializing the model in later years in the rotation sequence. Model evaluation was performed with the understanding that a large amount of variability was present in the data and that rotation effects other than water (e.g., diseases) were not accounted for by the model.The phenology sub-model proved sufficiently accurate, showing some limitation only in the case of winter cereals. Model simulations of maize, soybean, and barley growth at Modena, and sorghum and sunflower growth at Foggia were reasonably accurate. CropSyst was able to predict neither the yields of soybean grown as a second crop, nor the durum wheat yield variability in the rotations at Foggia. Although CropSyst was able to simulate reasonably well a number of cropping systems, the development of a more detailed field data base is desirable for further evaluation and improvement of the model for Italian conditions},

  volume = {31},
  abstract = {Sensitivity analyses for the preferential flow model MACRO were carried out using one-at-a-time and Monte Carlo sampling approaches. Four different scenarios were generated by simulating leaching to depth of two hypothetical pesticides in a sandy loam and a more structured clay loam soil. Sensitivity of the model was assessed using the predictions for accumulated water percolated at a 1-m depth and accumulated pesticide losses in percolation. Results for simulated percolation were similar for the two soils. Predictions of water volumes percolated were found to be only marginally affected by changes in input parameters and the most influential parameter was the water content defining the boundary between micropores and macropores in this dual-porosity model. In contrast, predictions of pesticide losses were found to be dependent on the scenarios considered and to be significantly affected by variations in input parameters. In most scenarios, predictions for pesticide losses by MACRO were most influenced by parameters related to sorption and degradation. Under specific circumstances, pesticide losses can be largely affected by changes in hydrological properties of the soil. Since parameters were varied within ranges that approximated their uncertainty, a first-step assessment of uncertainty for the predictions of pesticide losses was possible. Large uncertainties in the predictions were reported, although these are likely to have been overestimated by considering a large number of input parameters in the exercise. It appears desirable that a probabilistic framework accounting for uncertainty is integrated into the estimation of pesticide exposure for regulatory purposes.},

  abstract = {A dynamic simulation model for tomato crop growth and development, TOMSIM, is evaluated. Potential crop growth and daily crop gross assimilation rate (Pgc,d) is computed by integration of leaf assimilation rates over total crop leaf area throughout the day. Crop growth results fromPgc,dminus maintenance respiration rate (Rm), multiplied by the conversion efficiency. Dry matter distribution is simulated, based on the sink strength of the plant organs, which is quantified by their potential growth rate. Within the plant, individual fruit trusses and vegetative units (three leaves and stem internodes between two trusses) are distinguished. Sink strength of a truss or a vegetative unit is described as a function of its developmental stage. In this paper, emphasis is on the interactions between the two submodels of, respectively, dry matter production and dry matter distribution. Sensitivity analysis showed that global radiation, CO2concentration, specific leaf area (SLA) and the developmental stage of a vegetative unit at leaf pruning had a large influence on crop growth rate, whereas temperature, number of fruits per truss, sink strength of a vegetative unit and plant density were less important. Leaf area index (LAI) was very sensitive to SLA and the developmental stage of a vegetative unit at leaf pruning. Temperature did not influence the simulated Rm, as increased respiration rate per unit of biomass at higher temperatures was compensated by a decrease in biomass. The model was validated for four glasshouse experiments with plant density and fruit pruning treatments, and on data from two commercially grown crops. In general, measured and simulated crop growth rates from 1 month after planting onwards agreed reasonably well, average overestimation being 12\%. However, crop growth rates in the first month after planting were overestimated by 52\% on average. Final crop dry mass was overestimated by 0-31\%, due to inaccurate simulation of LAI, resulting partly from inaccurate SLA prediction, which is especially important at low plant density and in a young crop},

  abstract = {Simulation models of agro-ecological systems are typically written in a manner that precludes reusability of parts of the model without a significant amount of familiarity with and rewriting of existing code. Similarly, replacing a part of a model with a functionally equivalent part from another model is typically difficult. The objective of this study was to develop a method to enable the assembly of simulation models from previously and independently developed component models. Recent advances in software engineering have enabled the development of software applications from smaller parts (called components) on the basis of an abstract decomposition of the relevant domain (called a framework). Based on a requirements analysis of existing simulation models we developed the ModCom simulation framework. ModCom provides a set of interface specifications that describe components in a simulation. ModCom also provides implementations of the core simulation services. The framework interfaces use well-defined binary standards and allows developers to implement the interfaces using a broad range of computer languages. Using this framework, simulation models can be assembled by connecting component models in much the same way that Lego blocks are put together to assemble a house. ModCom thus allows modelers to create models and modeling tools that are easily exchanged (in binary form or source code) with colleagues across the hall or across the globe.},

  abstract = {The decision support system for agrotechnology transfer (DSSAT) has been in use for the last 15 years by researchers worldwide. This package incorporates models of 16 different crops with software that facilitates the evaluation and application of the crop models for different purposes. Over the last few years, it has become increasingly difficult to maintain the DSSAT crop models, partly due to fact that there were different sets of computer code for different crops with little attention to software design at the level of crop models themselves. Thus, the DSSAT crop models have been re-designed and programmed to facilitate more efficient incorporation of new scientific advances, applications, documentation and maintenance. The basis for the new DSSAT cropping system model (CSM) design is a modular structure in which components separate along scientific discipline lines and are structured to allow easy replacement or addition of modules. It has one Soil module, a Crop Template module which can simulate different crops by defining species input files, an interface to add individual crop models if they have the same design and interface, a Weather module, and a module for dealing with competition for light and water among the soil, plants, and atmosphere. It is also designed for incorporation into various application packages, ranging from those that help researchers adapt and test the CSM to those that operate the DSSAT-CSM to simulate production over time and space for different purposes. In this paper, we describe this new DSSAT-CSM design as well as approaches used to model the primary scientific components (soil, crop, weather, and management). In addition, the paper describes data requirements and methods used for model evaluation. We provide an overview of the hundreds of published studies in which the DSSAT crop models have been used for various applications. The benefits of the new, re-designed DSSAT-CSM will provide considerable opportunities to its developers and others in the scientific community for greater cooperation in interdisciplinary research and in the application of knowledge to solve problems at field, farm, and higher levels.},

  issn = {0308-521x},
  abstract = {One of the main goals of the International Consortium for Agricultural Systems Applications (ICASA) is to advance the development and application of compatible and complementary models, data and other systems analysis tools. To help reach that goal, it will adopt and recommend modular approaches that facilitate more systematic model development, documentation, maintenance, and sharing. In this paper, we present criteria and guidelines for modules that will enable them to be plugged into existing models to replace an existing component or to add a new one with minimal changes. This will make it possible to accept contributions from a wide group of modellers with specialities in different disciplines. Two approaches to modular model development have emerged from different research groups in ICASA. One approach was developed by extending the programming methods used in the Fortran Simulation Environment developed in The Netherlands. This method is being used in revisions of some of the Decision Support Systems for Agrotechnology Transfer crop models. A simple example of this approach is given in which a plant growth module is linked with a soil water balance module to create a crop model that simulates growth and yield for a uniform area. The second approach has been evolving within the Agricultural Production Systems Research Unit group in Australia. This approach, implemented in software called Agricultural Production Systems Simulator, consists of plug-in/pull-out modules and an infrastructure for inter-module communication. The two approaches have important similarities, but also differ in implementation details. In both cases, avoiding reliance on any particular programming language has been an important design criterion. By comparing features of both approaches, we have started to develop a set of recommendations for module design that will lead to a 'toolkit' of modules that can be shared throughout the ICASA network.},

Crops were sown on two dates in both growing seasons. Root-length density (RLD) and root dry weight were measured at four depths in three locations relative to the crop row. In general, RLD decreased considerably with depth, and by the start of pod-filling, around 60\% of the roots were found in the top 15cm of soil. In the upper 30cm soil profile, the RLDs of drought-stressed faba beans were significantly lower than those measured beneath well-watered crops. In the deeper soil layers, the RLDs were similar in both moisture supply treatments. An existing root model was employed for the simulation of faba bean root growth. The model estimates the depth of rooting and RLD in each soil layer based on dry matter allocation to the root system, soil layer water contents, genotype-specific rooting characteristics, and soil physical properties. A faba bean growth model provided daily allocation of dry matter to roots as well as soil layer water contents. Overall, with a few modifications, the root model was capable of predicting the RLD of faba bean grown both under limited and sufficient water supply realistically. Limitations of the model and some aspects that need further improvement are discussed.},

It combines the familiar System Dynamics (compartment-flow) paradigm with an object-based paradigm, allowing many forms of disaggregation to be handled, as well as spatial modelling and individual-based modelling. Its visual modelling interface makes it accessible to non-programmers, at the same time allowing models to be largely self-documenting. Models can be run very efficiently as compiled C++ programs, and users can develop new visualisation tools for displaying model results. Simile has been used in international research programmes, including the modelling of Mediterranean vegetation dynamics and modelling the interaction between households and land at the forest margin in developing countries. Simile has been developed in a spirit of open standards for model sharing. Models are saved as a text file in a structured format, with a view to enable model sharing with other modelling environments and to encourage others to develop additional tools for working with models.},

These cultivars were grown under different water (rainfed, 60\% and 100\% of crop water requirements) and nitrogen (without and with 100 kg N/ha) regimes in a Mediterranean type of environment at the Tel Hadya Research Station of ICARDA. Data from three contrasting growing seasons (1989/90 to 1991/1992) were used in these simulations. Soil characteristics, initial conditions of available moisture, N and organic matter, and daily weather data were input to CropSyst. Crop input parameters were mostly selected from the model documentation or determined from the experimental data. A few cultivar-specific parameters were adjusted within a narrow range of typical fluctuation by model calibration. Results showed that CropSyst was generally able to simulate evapotranspiration, crop N content, green leaf area, aboveground biomass, and grain yield as observed in the field experiments. Overall, the magnitude of the root mean square errors was about 10\% of the observed means with two exceptions (25\% and 32\%). Index of agreement between predicted and observed values fluctuated from 0.90 to 0.98 (a value of 1.0 indicating excellent agreement), with most values equal or better than 0.95.},

  volume = {57},
  issn = {0308-521x},
  abstract = {The need for tools to evaluate cropping systems and their impact on production and the environment is increasing. Field experiments, which are usually site specific, require considerable resources and time to test hypotheses or management options. Computer models for cropping systems simulation are an alternative, but they require calibration and validation before applications can be developed for a given region. The ability of CropSyst, a cropping systems simulation model, to simulate spring and winter wheat yields and evapotranspiration in a wheat-fallow region of eastern Washington for different tillage and residue management practices was evaluated. Validation of the model was accomplished by (a) providing initial conditions prior to planting for each cropping season of a 6-year wheat-fallow rotation and (b) providing initial conditions at the beginning of the rotation without reinitializing the model in later years. The statistical structure (mean and SD) of simulations and field data were similar. The root mean square errors fluctuated from 7 to 14\% of the observed mean for grain yield and from 5 to 9\% for evapotranspiration, depending on the type of evaluation, and was 17\% for soil moisture profile in the case of continuous 6-year rotation simulation without reinitialization. The Wilmott index of agreement fluctuated from 0.92 to 0.97 (an index of 1.0 indicating perfect agreement), with all values but one equal or better than 0.94. Similar water production functions were obtained from simulation and field data. Based on this validation, CropSyst appears promising as a tool to analyze the effectiveness of management practices for water conservation in a wheat-fallow cropping region.},

Model structure should be based on modules that (1) relate directly to real world components or processes; (2) have input and output variables that are measurable values; and (3) communicate solely via these input and output variables. Such a model structure has the advantage that it can be incrementally improved by simply replacing one module with another that has the same input and output variables. The underlying mechanism in the replacement module can be different, which facilitates the incorporation of the latest experimental research results and allows modulers to readily test alternative hypotheses about mechanisms. Thus, modularity and genericness open models to contributions from many authors, facilitate the comparison of alternative hypotheses, and extend the life and utility of simulation models.},

  abstract = {Background and AimsHybridization is an important evolutionary phenomenon, and therefore a detailed understanding of the dynamics of interspecific gene flow and resulting morphological and genetic patterns is of widespread interest. Here hybridization between the polyploids Cardamine pratensis and C. raphanifolia at four localities is explored. Using different types of data, the aim is to provide simultaneous and direct comparisons between genotype and phenotype variation patterns in the studied hybrid populations. MethodsEvidence of hybridization has been gathered from morphology, molecular markers (amplified fragment length polymorphism and chloroplast DNA sequences), pollen viability, karyology and nuclear DNA content. Key ResultsAll data support extensive gene flow occurring in the hybrid populations. A wide range of morphological and genetic variation is observed, which includes both parental and intermediate types. Unbalanced pollen fertility and several ploidy levels are recorded. ConclusionsIncongruence reported between genotype and phenotype suggests that parental phenotypes are affected by introgression, and intermediate hybrid phenotypes can be genetically closer to one of the parents. Thus, it is evident that morphology, when used alone, can be misleading for interpreting hybridization, and critical evaluation of other data is needed.},

Three bean types: soyabean (Glycine max L. Merr.), white bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and kidney bean (P . vulgaris L.) were included. The NT system included variations: rye (Secale cereale L.) or maize (Zea mays L.) cover crop, volunteer wheat disked after harvest and wheat stubble. Data were collected in 1994, 1995 and 1996. Tillage systems, cover crops and crop type had differential effects on weed densities, species composition and associations. Weed densities were not affected by tillage or cover crops in wheat but, in the beans, densities were greater in the CT than in the NT systems. Various associations of weed species with tillage system, cover crop and crop type were observed. Crop yields were not affected by tillage type or cover crop, except that soyabean yields were highest in plots with cover crops.},

  abstract = {Summary: Weeds have an important role in maintaining farmland biodiversity. This needs to be balanced with their potential negative impact on crop yield and quality. Mechanistic models of crop-weed competition are an important tool in striking this balance. A range of common UK annual weeds were screened for the eco-physiological traits required by the models. Using multivariate techniques, a number of functional groups with a similar pattern of productivity and competition were identified, based on trade-offs between traits. A scheme was developed to assign species outside of the data set to one of the groups, based on life cycle, seed mass, maximum height and time of first flowering. As well as having a similar competitive ability, species within a group also appeared to have a similar ecosystem function, in terms of supporting higher trophic groups. Two beneficial groups of species were identified that combined a relatively low competitive ability with a high importance for invertebrates and birds. The identification of functional groups in the UK arable flora is a useful tool for assessing a weed community in the context of reconciling biodiversity provision with crop production. Preserving beneficial plant functional types within the crop would complement non-cropped wildlife refuges, such as field margins},

Canonical variate analysis is the most appropriate technique to use whenever the multivariate data are grouped and to discriminate group differences using multiple variables. Principal component analysis, on the other hand, is used to develop linear combinations that successively maximize the total variance of a sample where there is no known group structure. However, when there are more variables than within-group degrees of freedom, due to the singularity of the within-group covariance matrix, canonical variates cannot be derived. The main aim of this paper is to explore such situations with an example from a biodiversity study and a further computer simulation; principal component analysis can be a viable substitute, if the between-group differences are prominent.},

  abstract = {A field experiment was carried out to analyse the growth of lettuce, onion and red beet in terms of: (a) canopy architecture, radiation interception and absorption; (b) efficiency of conversion of absorbed radiation into biomass; and (c) dry matter partitioning. Growth analysis, total solar radiation interception, PAR interception and absorption by the crop canopy, ground cover, maintenance respiration of onion bulbs and red beet storage roots were measured. Models for different leaf angle distribution and ground cover were used to simulate light transmission by the crop canopy.The three crops are shown to have contrasting growth patterns from both a morphological and a physiological point of view. Lettuce showed very high light interception and growth after the early growth stages but, throughout the growth cycle, this leafy crop showed the lowest radiation use efficiency due to the respirational cost of the high leaf area. Onion showed a lower early relative growth rate than lettuce and red beet. This was due partly to the low light interception per unit leaf area in the later stages of growth and partly to the low initial radiation use efficiency compared with the other two crops. On the other hand, thanks to more uniform distribution of the radiation inside the canopy, to the earlier termination of leaf development and to the very low level of bulb respiration, onion showed high radiation use efficiency and was able to produce a large amount of dry matter. Red beet leaf posture and canopy structure resulted in high light interception and absorption. Its radiation use efficiency was lower than that of onion, partly perhaps because of the more adverse distribution of the intercepted radiation fluxes within the canopy and partly because of the high respiration cost of a continuous dry-matter allocation to the leaves. However, this crop can accumulate a very large amount of dry matter as leaf blade development and storage root growth can both continue almost indefinitely, providing continuously available sinks.Ground cover gave a good estimate of the PAR interception only at low values of light interception but, in general, it underestimated PAR interception in all three crops. Ratios between attenuation coefficients established by considering PAR or total solar radiation and LAI or ground cover were calculated.},

We clustered the samples based on similarities in the phylogenetic lineages that they contain and found that, surprisingly, the major environmental determinant of microbial community composition is salinity rather than extremes of temperature, pH, or other physical and chemical factors represented in our samples. We find that sediments are more phylogenetically diverse than any other environment type. Surprisingly, soil, which has high species-level diversity, has below-average phylogenetic diversity.

  volume = {27},
  abstract = {The problem of identifying subtle time-space clustering of disease, as may be occurring in leukemia, is described and reviewed. Published approaches, generally associated with studies of leukemia, not dependent on knowledge of the underlying population for their validity, are directed towards identifying clustering by establishing a relationship between the temporal and the spatial separations for the n(n - 1)/2 possible pairs which can be formed from the n observed cases of disease. Here it is proposed that statistical power can be improved by applying a reciprocal transform to these separations. While a permutational approach can give valid probability levels for any observed association, for reasons of practicability, it is suggested that the observed association be tested relative to its permutational variance. Formulas and computational procedures for doing so are given. While the distance measures between points represent symmetric relationships subject to mathematical and geometric regularities, the variance formula developed is appropriate for arbitrary relationships. Simplified procedures are given for the case of symmetric and skew-symmetric relationships. The general procedure is indicated as being potentially useful in other situations as, for example, the study of interpersonal relationships. Viewing the procedure as a regression approach, the possibility for extending it to nonlinear and multivariate situations is suggested. Other aspects of the problem and of the procedure developed are discussed. Similarly, pure temporal clustering can be identified by a study of incidence rates in periods of widespread epidemics. In point of fact, many epidemics of communicable diseases are somewhat local in nature and so these do actually constitute temporal-spatial clusters. For leukemia and similar diseases in which cases seem to arise substantially at random rather than as clear-cut epidemics, it is necessary to devise sensitive and efficient procedures for detecting any nonrandom component of disease occurrence. Various ingenious procedures which statisticians have developed for the detection of disease clustering are reviewed here. These procedures can be generalized so as to increase their statistical validity and efficiency. The technic to be given below for imparting statistical validity to the procedures already in vogue can be viewed as a generalized form of regression with possible useful application to problems arising in quite different contexts.},

These methods have relied on pedigree data, morphological data, agronomic performance data, biochemical data, and more recently molecular (DNA-based) data. For reasonably accurate and unbiased estimates of genetic diversity, adequate attention has to be devoted to (i) sampling strategies; (ii) utilization of various data sets on the basis of the understanding of their strengths and constraints; (iii) choice of genetic distance measure(s), clustering procedures, and other multivariate methods in analyses of data; and (iv) objective determination of genetic relationships. Judicious combination and utilization of statistical tools and techniques, such as bootstrapping, is vital for addressing complex issues related to data analysis and interpretation of results from different types of data sets, particularly through clustering procedures.

  abstract = {In the early stages of a plant selection program, field experiments are characterized by having many test lines and a limited amount of material available for each line. The present design was proposed to cope with such experimental conditions by using control plots to adjust for environmental heterogeneity. The structure is a split-plot design, where the whole-plots can be laid out in any standard design, but the arrangements of subplots is always 3 x 3 with the centre point used as a control. The shape of subplot needs to be square or nearly square, so that the distances between the centre plot and its corresponding eight test plots are relatively uniform. The control lines are assigned to the control plots according to the design specification for the whole-plots, and the test lines are assigned randomly to the noncontrol plots. The number of control plots under the present design is approximately 13-17\% of the total number of plots. The p x p Latin square is used as an example to demonstrate the basic idea of the design. Methods of analysis are also discussed.},

  volume = {43},
  abstract = {Knowledge of interrelationships between grain yield and its contributing components will improve the efficiency of breeding programs through the use of appropriate selection indices. Previous path analyses studies in maize (Zea mays L.) treated yield components as first-order variables. The present study, based on evaluation of 90 experimental maize hybrids (comprising one diallel and one line x tester set) at two locations in India, utilizes a sequential path model for analysis of genetic associations among grain yield and its related traits by ordering the various variables in first-, second-, and third-order paths on the basis of their maximum direct effects and minimal collinearity. The sequential path model showed distinct advantages over the conventional path model in discerning the actual effects of different predictor variables. Two first-order variables, namely 100-grain weight and total number of kernels per ear, revealed highest direct effects on total grain weight (p = 0.74 and p = 0.78, respectively), while ear length, ear diameter, number of kernel rows, and number of kernels per row were found to fit as second-order variables. All direct effects were found to be significant, as indicated by bootstrap analysis. Test for the goodness-of-fit revealed that the sequential path model provided better fit to various datasets analyzed in the study. Correlations between the predicted values of various response variables in the second season dataset based on the path coefficients of the first season were high, except for ear length and number of kernels per row. The applicability of the model has been confirmed through analysis of two additional datasets during 2000. The results indicated the utility of the sequential path model for determining the interrelationships among grain yield and related traits in maize.},

  abstract = {The current study investigated the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bacillus subtilis, used as probiotics, on the microflora, morphology, and morphometry of the gut in organic laying hens. The birds (180 Hy-Line laying hens) were divided into 3 homogenous groups and received a pre-deposition diet from 16 to 20 wk of age and a deposition diet for the remaining 7 months of the experiment. The control group (CTR) was fed a corn-soybean cake-based diet, the second group (L) received the same diet supplemented with 0.1\% of L. acidophilus while in the third group (B) the basal diet was supplemented with 0.05\% of B. subtilis. At 18 wk of age (T1) and at 5 (T2) and 7 months (T3) from the beginning of deposition, 9 subjects per group were humanely killed for microbiological, morphological and morphometric analyses of the intestinal tract. The 2 probiotic-supplemented diets increased Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. counts compared with the CTR diet. The lowest viable counts of E. coli, coliforms and staphylococci were observed in the L group (P $<$~0.001). Clostridium spp. decreased (P $<$~0.001) in both L and B subjects. The probiotic supplementation appeared to affect the intestinal microbial population, promoting the presence of beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. and reducing potential harmful bacteria such as E. coli, clostridia and staphylococci. Morphological and morphometric analyses did not reveal substantial differences among groups. At T3, the plasma cell infiltrate in the villi of the CTR hens was more severe than that observed in the L and B groups (P = 0.009).},

  abstract = {The aim of model GeneSys is to rank cropping systems according to their risk of gene escape from genetically modified, herbicide tolerant winter oilseed rape cultivars to rapeseed volunteers. The model integrates the effects of crop succession and crop management at the level of a region. The first part of the model presented in this paper describes the temporal evolution of rapeseed volunteers in a field, using an annual life-cycle comprising stages such as seed bank, seedlings, adult plants, flowers or freshly produced seeds. The relationships between the various stages depend on the crops grown each year and the cultivation techniques (stubble breaking, soil tillage, sowing date and density, herbicides, cutting and harvesting). Parameter values were either deduced from existing models and literature, or estimated from experimental studies and field surveys. The extension of the temporal sub-model to include the genetic evolution of rapeseed volunteers and the spatial dimension is presented in a second paper [Colbach, N., Clermont-Dauphin, C., Meynard, J.M., 2001.

  abstract = {This paper aims to examine some of the reasons behind public controversy associated with the introduction of genetically modified foods in Europe the 1990s. The historical background to the controversy is provided to give context. The issue of public acceptance of genetically modified foods, and indeed the emerging biosciences more generally, is considered in the context of risk perceptions and attitudes, public trust in regulatory institutions, scientists, and industry, and the need to develop communication strategies that explicitly include public concerns rather than exclude them. Increased public participation has been promoted as a way of increasing trust in institutional practices associated with the biosciences, although questions still arise as to how to best utilise the outputs of such exercises in policy development. This issue will become more of a priority as decision-making systems become more transparent and open to public scrutiny. The results are discussed in the context of risk assessment and risk management, and recommendations for future research are made. In particular, it is recommended that new methods are developed in order to integrate public values more efficaciously into risk analysis processes, specifically with respect to the biosciences and to technology implementation in general.},

  abstract = {Companion weed species in wheat and pea crops are influenced by the physiology, canopy structure, and management practices of these crops. Pea and wheat fields were surveyed in the central Rolling Pampa to compare the weed communities, and to determine the association among weed community structure, crop management practices, and yield. The floristic and functional structure of weed communities was evaluated for species richness and abundance. Floristic groups and their relationships with crop yield and management were analysed using multivariate methods. The weed community of pea crops was more diverse than that of wheat crops at both regional and field scales. Alpha diversity was 20 and 13 for pea and wheat, respectively, while gamma diversity was 91 for pea and 64 for wheat. In both crops, the structure of the weed communities was related to yield, chemical control practices, fertilization and the previous crop. Crop dominance, as accounted by crop growth and herbicides effects, was the main factor defining the weed community structure. Fertilization and previous crop had a secondary effect. Similar proportions of dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous species occurred in both crops, probably because of climatic factors operating at regional scale.},

A model for survival data allowing a permanent survival fraction, non-monotonic failure rates and unobserved frailty is considered here. Regressions are used to explain both the failure time and permanent survival mechanisms and additive correlated errors are included in the general linear models defining these regressions. A hierarchical Bayesian approach is adopted with likelihood conditional on the random frailty effects and a second stage prior defining the bivariate density of those effects. The gain in model fit, and potential effects on inference, from adding frailty is demonstrated in a case study application to age at first maternity in Germany.},

However, AMMI had required data for every genotype and environment combination or treatment; i.e., missing data were inadmissible. The present paper addresses the problem. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is implemented for fitting AMMI depite missing data. This missing-data version of AMMI is here termed EM-AMMI EM-AMMI is used to quantify the direct and indirect information in a yield trial, providing theoretical insight into the gain in accuracy observed and into the process of imputing missing data. For a given treatment, the direct yield data are the replicates of that treatment, and the indirect data are all the other yield data in the trial. EM-AMMI is used to inpute missing data for a New York soybean yield trial. Important applications arise from both unintentional and intentional missing data. Empirical measurements demonstrate good predictive success, and statistical theory attributes this success to the Stein effect.},

Lagreze-Fossat) as well as between rape and wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum L.). The first experiment dealt with seed survival in undisturbed soil over 41 months. It showed a slow decrease in viability of the seeds of hoary mustard, a quick drop to a constant 1\% viability of rape, and intermediary behaviour of hybrids. The second experiment was conducted at two field sites in eastern and southern France, with normal cultivation and crop growth during 3 years. Quantitative differences were observed between the two sites, although the relative behaviour of each seed type was similar. Hoary mustard had the greatest seed viability, on average 14\% after 3 years, while total seedling emergence in the field was 1.9\% after 3 years. The decrease of the viability of rape seed was slower than in the undisturbed experiment, with more than 1\% viable seeds remaining after 3 years. Total emergence of rape was up to 4\%. Hybrids showed lower seed viability than rape. Total seedling emergence over 3 years was less than 1\%. These results are discussed together with the consequences of commercial release of transgenic crops. Transgenes can escape via seeds and volunteer rape, and seeds of interspecific hybrids between rape and wild relatives can survive and germinate after several years, ensuring genetic and spatial spread of transgenes.},

  volume = {74},
  abstract = {Ecological studies typically involve comparison of biological responses among a variety of environmental conditions. When the response variables have continuous distributions and the conditions are discrete, whether inherently or by design, then it is appropriate to analyze the data using analysis of variance (ANOVA). When data conform to a complete, balanced design (equal numbers of observations in each experimental treatment), it is straightforward to conduct an ANOVA, particularly with the aid of the numerous statistical computing packages that are available. Interpretation of an ANOVA of balanced data is also unambiguous. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, it is rare that a practicing ecologist embarks on an analysis of data that are completely balanced. Regardless of its cause, lack of balance necessitates care in the analysis and interpretation. In this paper, our aims is to provide an overview of the consequences of lack of balance and to give some guidelines to analyzing unbalanced data for models involving fixed effects. Our treatment is necessarily cursory and will not substitute for training available from a sequence of courses in mathematical statistics and linear models. It is intended to introduce the reader to the main issues and to the extensive statistical literature that deals with them. See full-text article at JSTOR},

A particular adaptation, which we have used, is one in which animals from the same litter have been assigned to different treatment groups, e.g., some to a control group and some to a drug treatment group. The time to response used was that of tumor appearance; death from other causes was considered a loss to observation. The initial litter-adjusted analysis seemed to have only limited advantages compared to analysis that ignored litters and could be interpreted as suggesting that litter matching was not advantageous. Contributing to the difficulty was the fact that in the litter-matched analysis no further information was forthcoming from the remaining similarly treated animals in a litter when there were no remaining contrastingly treated littermates. Several devices for recovering interlitter information from such remnants and for combining it with intralitter information are examined and applied.},

Wei, Lin, and Weissfeld (1989, Journal of the American Statistical Association 84, 1065-1073) and Lee, Wei, and Amato (1992, in Survival Analysis: State of the Art) showed that, if the marginal distributions of the correlated survival times follow a proportional hazards model, then the estimates from Cox's partial likelihood (Cox, D. R., 1972, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B 24, 187-220), naively treating the correlated survival times as independent, give consistent estimates of the relative risk parameters. However, because of the correlation between survival times, the inverse of the information matrix may not be a consistent estimate of the asymptotic variance. Wei et al. (1989) and Lee et al. (1992) proposed a robust variance estimate that is consistent for the asymptotic variance. We show that a "one-step" jackknife estimator of variance is asymptotically equivalent to their variance estimator. The jackknife variance estimator may be preferred because an investigator needs only to write a simple loop in a computer package instead of a more involved program to compute Wei et al. (1989) and Lee et al.'s (1992) estimator.},

Measurements were made in spring and winter sown rape to determine amounts lost by natural shedding from standing crop and ripening swaths and from the machine operations for a direct cut crop and a swathed crop. Combine threshing and separation losses were not measured.A randomized plot experiment compared losses from a direct cut and a swathed crop when harvested at the recommended agronomic stage of maturity and at a later date. Samples of losses occurring from ripening crop and as a result of the harvesting process were measured. Trays placed in the standing crop and beneath ripening swaths collected naturally occurring losses. Trays placed in the crop beneath working machines collected losses from direct cutting, swathing and picking up by swaths by undercutting or the use of a draper (tined conveyor) pick-up. During direct cutting and swathing, groups of trays in carefully selected locations collected seed shed by the side knife, cutterbar and central area of the headers where crop is brought together before entering the elevator or forming the swath.Overall losses in winter rape were around 11\% for direct cutting at both recommended and late timings, of which 4\dbend\dbend{}7\% to 6\dbend\dbend{}4\% were from natural shedding. In the swathed crop, losses ranged from 10\dbend\dbend{}7\% to 24\dbend\dbend{}8\%, with much lower natural shedding losses of zero to 1\dbend\dbend{}8\%, the highest losses resulting from the late swathing operation.

  abstract = {The proliferation of genetically modified crops has created a need for methods to predict the likelihood of gene introgression into related species in situ. We present a model of a modified crop and an associated unmodified plant population removed spatially from the modified crop but not completely isolated from it, reflecting standard practices for isolation of field trials. We develop models for two kinds of life histories, broadly based on Brassica and Gossypium, taxa that are targets for genetic modification. We find that current prescriptions for field trials are likely to lead to escape of transgenes into wild populations when outcrossing rates are moderate and hybrids are fertile. The results are sensitive to pollen rain within plausible bounds for model parameters, suggesting buffer widths are an important aspect of the design of field trials. When gene introgression requires the spontaneous development of a polyploid, the likelihood of gene introgression is lower but still appreciable in realistic circumstances. Events that are unlikely over periods of a few years become almost certain within scales of a few decades, emphasising the need for gene risk assessments to be set in specified time frames. The models serve to identify the parts of the system that are poorly known and that are important in determining outcomes, providing a focus for future research. There is a need for research on the consequences of changes in fitness due to the transgenes, competitive interactions between related species, and the broader ecological consequences of changes in agricultural practice resulting from the use of genetically modified crops.},

  volume = {81},
  issn = {1537-5110},
  abstract = {Oilseed rape has the potential to expand as an industrial crop. However, as oilseed rape matures, seed loss occurs by dehiscence of the seed from the pods prior to harvest and also as a result of crop disturbance by machinery during harvest. Seed loss of 600 kg ha?1, 25\% of the recorded yield, is not uncommon. This directly increases the price for industrial users and can also reduce oil purity because volunteer plants in subsequent oilseed rape crops may have a different oil fatty acid profile. Oilseed rape plants also persist as weeds in subsequent crops. An experiment was carried out to identify the cause of, and quantify contributions to, seed loss from two different designs of header fitted to the combine harvester; a standard header and a header with a conveyor fitted behind the cutterbar, claimed to assist crop flow into the auger. Seed loss was measured using trays placed in the ripening crop prior to harvest. Seed shed before harvest, 11 kg ha?1, was low as a result of the relatively settled weather conditions. There was a significant difference between losses from the two types of header. The loss from each side knife was the same, but because of the differing header widths, translated into losses of 18\dbend{}4 and 34\dbend{}6 kg ha?1 for the conveyor-assisted and standard headers, respectively, showing the advantage of using a wider header in reducing this loss. Excluding shedding loss and side knife losses, seed loss from the conveyor-assisted header was 59 kg h?1 against 104 kg h?1 with the standard header. Loss caused only by the cutterbar of the conveyor-assisted header, 27 kg ha?1, was less than half that of the standard header cutterbar, showing the effectiveness of the combination of forward positioning of the cutterbar and conveyor-assistance. At 2001 costs, the conveyor-assisted header would recover its additional purchase price in five years if used to harvest 171 ha of oilseed rape per year.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to predict future implant survival using information on risk factors and on the survival status of an individual's existing implant(s). We considered a retrospective cohort study with 677 individuals having 2349 implants placed. We proposed to predict the survival probabilities using the Cox proportional hazards frailty model, with three important risk factors: smoking status, timing of placement, and implant staging. For a non-smoking individual with 2 implants placed, an immediate implant and in one stage, the marginal probability that 1 implant would survive 12 months was 85.8\% (95\%CI: 77\%, 91.7\%), and the predicted joint probability of surviving for 12 months was 75.1\% (95\%CI: 62.1\%, 84.7\%). If 1 implant was placed earlier and had survived for 12 months, then the second implant had an 87.5\% (95\%CI: 80.3\%, 92.4\%) chance of surviving 12 months. Such conditional and joint predictions can assist in clinical decision-making for individuals.},

  abstract = {As one samples species from a particular assemblage, the initial rapid rate with which new species are encountered declines with increasing effort. Nine candidate models to characterize species2013accumulation functions were compared in a search for a model that consistently fit geographically extensive avian survey data from a wide range of environmental conditions. Landscape-specific species2013accumulation curves generated under a bootstrap resampling plan were best described by a generalized Weibull cumulative distribution function. Traditional species2013area models of cumulative species richness as a function of accumulated sample had notable functional bias. The Weibull model fitted species2013accumulation data equally well among sixty-six forested landscapes in the eastern U.S. Landscapes with a greater proportion of agricultural and urban land uses accumulated species more slowly than landscapes which retained a greater proportion of natural habitats (r=22120.64, P\&lt;0.001). This finding supports predictions of ecosystem behavior under human land use. There was no evidence that intermediate levels of land use intensity maximized accumulation rates. The approach reviewed in this paper makes no assumptions about the form of the species2013abundance distribution or how species are distributed in space, thereby offering some advantages over more conventional diversity indices for characterizing how species assemblages respond to anthropogenic disturbance. Investigation of how species accumulation varies over time in a given geographic area is needed to evaluate fully the potential application of this approach to regional land use planning.},

White (1982, Econometrica 50, 1-26) proposed a variance estimator for \$$\backslash$hat$\backslash$beta\$ that is robust to model misspecification. We show that a "one-step" jackknife estimator of variance is asymptotically equivalent to the variance estimator proposed by White. The one-step variance estimator may be preferred when the appropriate computer packages are not available to compute White's estimator directly. This jackknife estimator is very useful in our example with clustered survival data.},

  abstract = {The minimum sampling areas (MSAs) for the shrub communities in the arid valley in the upper reach of the Minjiang River, China, were studied by fitting community species-area relationships using 3 types of equations. The MSAs were determined at the proportional factor ([rho]) 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9. The proportional factors represent the proportion of the number of species within a sampling plot in the total number of species. The MSAs of the shrub communities at different elevations and on different slope faces for [rho] = 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8 were all around 100 m2. Hence, the MSAs could be set to be 100 m2 (10 m x 10 m) at 60\%-80\% precision levels. For [rho] = 0.9, that is, for a 90\% precision level, the MSAs were less than 200 m2 (10 m x 20 m). The MSAs and species richness increased gradually with the rising elevation. At the elevation below 2000 m, the MSAs and species richness on the north-facing slope were larger than those on the south-facing slope. However, at the elevation around 2200 m, there was no difference amongst different facing slopes. For the shrub communities in the arid valley in the upper reach of the Minjiang River, the species-area curves by fitting the first two equations are better than that by fitting the third equation.},

In recent years, the area under lucerne has increased from 20 to 800ha. The aim is to ultimately have all pasture on the property as lucerne-based perennial pastures. The lucerne is sown with a no-till seeder in rows 250mm apart. In two contiguous rows in every five rows, barley is sown with the lucerne to provide protection to the young lucerne plants from sand particles carried by high winds in the sandy-surfaced soils of the region. The barley also provides an income stream in the year of establishment of the lucerne. The lucerne-based pastures are the foundation of a phase-farming system. A period of lucerne varying in length from 2 to 10 years is followed by a cropping phase of 3-10 years. The lucerne pastures are rotationally grazed for 1-2 weeks with 5-6 weeks between grazing. The lucerne provides nitrogen to subsequent crops and assists with the control of volunteer grasses and summer weeds. It also uses water that otherwise would leak past the root zone and lead to rising water tables and secondary salinity.},

  abstract = {Volunteer plants of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) from persistent seeds in soil can affect subsequent crops. Apart from the agricultural disadvantages, the environment and the marketing of the seeds may also be affected, particularly if plants with special ingredients or genetically modified (gm) plants are grown. In order to investigate the influence of soil cultivation and genotype on seed persistence and gene flow via volunteers, a field experiment was set up testing four tillage treatments and two cultivars in a split-plot design. The cultivars tested were near-isogenic to two gm cultivars. To simulate harvesting losses, 10\hphantom{,}000 seeds m?2 were broadcast on a soil in July. The subsequent tillage treatments were combinations of immediate or delayed stubble tillage by a rotary tiller, primary tillage with plough or cultivator, or zero tillage. Over the following year, the fate of the seeds was determined. Immediate stubble tillage with following cultivator or plough resulted in 586 resp. 246 seeds m?2 in the soil seed bank. After delayed stubble tillage with following plough, 76 seeds m?2 were found, and no soil seed bank was built up in the zero tillage treatment. Nevertheless, in the zero tillage treatment, several robust volunteer plants survived the herbicide application before the direct drilling in autumn until following spring. In the zero tillage treatment and in the cultivator treatment, 0.19 volunteers m?2 resp. 0.06 volunteers m?2 flowered simultaneously to ordinarily sown oilseed rape in the following crop of winter wheat and produced 73 resp. 18 seeds m?2. Delayed stubble tillage reduced the risk of gene escape via the soil seed bank, while zero tillage resulted in the highest risk of gene escape by pollen and by production of a new generation of seeds. In terms of a labelling threshold for gm food this number of seeds would be below the threshold of 0.9\% of transgenic parts in conventially bred food or feed.},

The simple arithmetic mean is not a useful measure, because due to the unbalancedness it may yield biased and thus misleading information. Some form of adjustment for diverging environmental effects is therefore needed. In this paper we advocate the use of a simple and well known least squares method to compute adjusted means. The method is exemplified using a published example on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).},

  volume = {98},
  abstract = {Builders of management growth and yield models have shown ingenuity in supplying projection equations with additional variables (for example, site index, time and amount of thinning) to enhance the quality of predictions. Other variables, edaphic or mechanistic in origin, have not been utilised because of difficulties in obtaining precise areal estimates at an affordable cost. Environmental (for example, rainfall, solar radiation) data have become available through response surface splining algorithms using data from weather station networks; long-term climate averages are available at any chosen location. This paper describes the building of mean-top-height and basal area ha\^a\textasciicircum{}'1 projection equations, utilising climate variables in conjunction with traditional plot measures. The data were secured from the Nelson region of New Zealand, where stands of Pinus radiata are established on four contrasting soil groupings. No improvement in precision was found for the prediction of mean-top-height, by including temperature, solar radiation, or rainfall data, nor by recognising the diverse soils. Conversely, an improvement of 10\% was obtained in modelling basal area ha\^a\textasciicircum{}'1. Radiation and rainfall (but not temperature) significantly improved precision and accuracy, varying in functional form by soil type. The individual effects of soil-type and climate are heavily confounded. It is argued that forest process and empirical-based modelling has been independently researched for too long. There is evidence enough to suggest that hybrid modelling, encompassing both approaches, could improve the predictive ability of current growth prediction systems.},

when farmyard manure or compost are not sufficiently treated (Mt Pleasant \& Schlater, 1994). These
factors alter crop/weed competition and weed population dynamics both within and across growing
cycles, the latter as related to (1) carry over of nutrients and (2) weed seed input from organic materials and/or uncontrolled late-emerging weeds (Bastiaans \& Drenth, 1999; Liebman \& Davis,2000). A good practice is localisation of organic fertilisers/amendments close to the crop row, when this is feasible.
Phisical weed control is less effective than chemical weed control, both on the short and on the long term. In particular, successful Phisical Weed Control must rely on concurrent application of cultural weed management, aimed to (1) reduce weed emergence by using preventive methods (crop sequence choice, smother crops - soffocanti, primary tillage, false seedbed technique), and (2) reduce weed competition by improving crop competitive ability (appropriate use of crop genotypes, transplants, sowing/planting pattern, fertilisation strategy).},

We developed a second model assuming independence of the clustered observations (naive method). The 95\% confidence intervals for survival prediction point estimates given the naive method were 5.9\% to 14.3\% more narrow than the dependence method estimates, resulting in an increased risk for type I error and erroneous rejection of the null hypothesis. To obtain statistically valid confidence intervals for survival prediction of the Aalen-Breslow estimates, we recommend adjusting for dependence among clustered survival observations.},

A simple analytic approach is to impute the infection time by the mid-point of the interval and then apply standard survival techniques for right censored data. The objective of this paper is to investigate the statistical properties of such a mid-point imputation approach. We investigated the asymptotic bias of the Kaplan-Meier estimate, coverage probabilities of associated confidence intervals, bias in hazard ratio, and the size of the logrank test. We show that the statistical properties of mid-point imputation depend strongly on the underlying distributions of infection times and the incubation periods, and the width of the interval between screening tests. In the absence of treatment, the median incubation period of HIV infection is approximately 10 years, and we conclude that, for this situation, mid-point imputation is a reasonable procedure for interval widths of 2 years or less.},

The models attempt to estimate simultaneously the effects of covariates on the acceleration/deceleration of the timing of a given event and the surviving fraction; that is, the proportion of the population for which the event never occurs. The extended family of the generalized Gamma distribution is used for the accelerated failure-time regression model; the logistic function is used for the regression model of the surviving fraction. The models are applied to the data of interfirm job mobility in Japan to assess variability in "permanent employment" among white collar and blue collar employees in firms of different sizes, independent from their variability in the timing of interfirm job separations.},

The cohort was composed of 660 patients who had 2286 implants placed. Due to the high success rates of implants, the five-year survival point and standard error estimates varied little among the three models. Patients at high risk for implant failure (smokers) manifested greater variation in the standard error estimates among the three models, 8.2\%, 4.0\%, and 5.6\%, respectively. To obtain statistically valid survival confidence intervals when performing Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, we recommend adjusting for dependence when there are multiple observations within the same subject.},

  abstract = {A simple mechanistic model is presented which describes population dynamics of volunteer oilseed rape within a field. The model calculates the number of volunteers appearing in each crop and the seedbank after each crop. The main input variables are harvesting losses when the crop is oilseed rape, crop rotation, soil cultivation, soil moisture content within the arable soil layer and the level of volunteer control in each crop in the rotation. Simulation studies suggest that there are a number of agronomic means of minimising volunteer oilseed rape populations effectively. The amount of harvesting losses, the time span between oilseed rape harvest and the first tillage operation post-harvest, the efficiency of controlling oilseed rape in other crops and rotation itself are key components of a programme for ensuring that volunteer oilseed rape populations are minimised.Simulation runs showed that the proportion of volunteer plants within a crop of oilseed rape will be relatively high, even though the density of volunteers is low in other crops. This contamination of a rape crop could be a particular problem in the context of the cultivation of genetically modified rape.The model would benefit from improved estimates of some parameters. More data are particularly necessary on the long-term development of a seedbank of oilseed rape and the relationship between the size of the seedbank and the number of volunteers in various crops.},

  abstract = {This paper provides guidance on how to assess the safety of foods derived from genetically modified crops (GM crops); it summarises conclusions and recommendations of Working Group 1 of the ENTRANSFOOD project. The paper provides an approach for adapting the test strategy to the characteristics of the modified crop and the introduced trait, and assessing potential unintended effects from the genetic modification. The proposed approach to safety assessment starts with the comparison of the new GM crop with a traditional counterpart that is generally accepted as safe based on a history of human food use (the concept of substantial equivalence). This case-focused approach ensures that foods derived from GM crops that have passed this extensive test-regime are as safe and nutritious as currently consumed plant-derived foods. The approach is suitable for current and future GM crops with more complex modifications. First, the paper reviews test methods developed for the risk assessment of chemicals, including food additives and pesticides, discussing which of these methods are suitable for the assessment of recombinant proteins and whole foods. Second, the paper presents a systematic approach to combine test methods for the safety assessment of foods derived from a specific GM crop. Third, the paper provides an overview on developments in this area that may prove of use in the safety assessment of GM crops, and recommendations for research priorities. It is concluded that the combination of existing test methods provides a sound test-regime to assess the safety of GM crops. Advances in our understanding of molecular biology, biochemistry, and nutrition may in future allow further improvement of test methods that will over time render the safety assessment of foods even more effective and informative.},

Data were compiled from the literature and an attempt was made at determining the efficiency of possible crosses between annual and perennial species. The risk of a cultivated allele escaping from sunflower to uncontrolled forms (volunteers, H. annuus and H. tuberosus feral forms) was addressed, the fate of such alleles in the wild also being examined. An attempt was made to define some of the pressures likely to limit the spread of wild forms in nature, or that could prevent or impede the spread and increase the frequency of alleles from cultivated plants. Risks of spread of transgenes from sunflower varieties in Europe where feral forms are present but no natural Helianthus species were assessed.

In the present work, the model was improved to simulate simultaneously the spread of three different genes. Four different regions were then surveyed from 1995 to 2001: one region comprised only farmers' fields with frequent rape crops in the rotations; the three remaining regions comprised the French experimental GMO platforms with 2-3 GM and one non-GM rape variety as well as neighbour farmers' fields. For all these fields, cropping history was recorded during the study and for at least three previous years. In the first region, rapeseed volunteers were assessed in crops as well as on road and field margins in 1 year. In the three remaining regions, volunteer densities and genotypes were assessed each year after harvest and rape harvest genotypes determined during 2 years. The comparison of simulated and observed data showed that the model usually satisfactorily predicts volunteer densities and genotype proportions as well as harvest genotype proportions. Several problem areas were identified: volunteers in road and field margins were usually badly predicted; the model frequently underestimated volunteer densities in spring crops; gene flow via pollen dispersal was underestimated when the distance from the pollen source increased. The model was then used to simulate the spread of herbicide-tolerant rape volunteers in a region grown with one or several GM herbicide-tolerant varieties and more particularly the stacking of several resistance genes in individuals. The simulations also showed the contamination of the harvest of non-GM rape varieties by GM seeds resulting from gene flow.},

  abstract = {Rapeseed volunteers in rapeseed crops can cause contamination in harvest through pollen and seeds. The aim of the study was to predict pollen and seed production by volunteers in winter rapeseed crops according to the genotypes of the crop and the volunteers. Firstly an experimental analysis of intraspecific competition was carried out in 2000 and 2001 on two and six genotypes, respectively. The main competition period begins with vegetation onset and affects pollen and seed production of the volunteers. Relations between density, height, yield and number of flowers were developed based on results from experiments and literature. Knowing the densities and heights of volunteers and crop on the plot, the yield of the volunteers can be predicted. For example, for volunteers 60cm lower (higher) than the crop, at a density of 1volunteer/m2 in a crop at a density of 50plants/m2, the seed production per plant of the volunteers is 12\% (112\%) of the production observed on a field of pure volunteers at 50plants/m2. We propose to include the equation predicting volunteer production in the gene flow model, GeneSys-Rape, in order to manage cropping systems according to harvest purity goals.},

  abstract = {Summary: The study examined the effect of tillage (intensive vs. zero tillage) on potential gene flow during the life cycle of oilseed rape volunteers between July 2002 and August 2003. After growing oilseed rape, 4-29\% of the seeds lost during harvest entered the soil seedbank when stubble tillage was performed immediately after the seed input. The seedbank was small (0-3\%) when stubble tillage was delayed. Zero tillage resulted in seedbanks from 1 to 17\% of the initial seed input. The seeds were distributed mainly in the upper soil layers after zero tillage or primary tillage with a rigid tine cultivator, whereas ploughing shifted most of the seeds into deeper layers. The highest number of volunteers (1 plant m?2) emerged and flowered in the following crop of winter wheat either when a large soil seedbank existed and/or the seedbank was located mainly in the upper soil layer. Outcrossing with other rape crops was unlikely as volunteers flowered 1?month later than rape crops sown at the normal timing. These volunteers produced a maximum of 8 viable seeds m?2. Ploughing preserved seeds in deep soil layers transferring the risk of gene flow to the future, whereas non-inversion tillage can cause gene flow from high numbers of flowering volunteers within the first year following oilseed rape cultivation.},

  abstract = {The commercialisation of GM crops in Europe is practically non-existent at the present time. The European Commission has instigated changes to the regulatory process to address the concerns of consumers and member states and to pave the way for removing the current moratorium. With regard to the safety of GM crops and products, the current risk assessment process pays particular attention to potential adverse effects on human and animal health and the environment. This document deals with the concept of unintended effects in GM crops and products, i.e. effects that go beyond that of the original modification and that might impact primarily on health. The document first deals with the potential for unintended effects caused by the processes of transgene insertion (DNA rearrangements) and makes comparisons with genetic recombination events and DNA rearrangements in traditional breeding. The document then focuses on the potential value of evolving \dbend\_oprofiling\dbend\_\_ or \dbend\_oomics\dbend\_\_ technologies as non-targeted, unbiased approaches, to detect unintended effects. These technologies include metabolomics (parallel analysis of a range of primary and secondary metabolites), proteomics (analysis of polypeptide complement) and transcriptomics (parallel analysis of gene expression). The technologies are described, together with their current limitations. Importantly, the significance of unintended effects on consumer health are discussed and conclusions and recommendations presented on the various approaches outlined.},

Abundant species were Cirsium arvense, Elymus repens, Matricaria perforata, Poa annua and Stellaria media. With no-tillage, grassland perennials were detected. Volunteer oats increased in plots without ploughing. A combination of glyphosate and post-emergence herbicide was necessary to control different biological groups of weeds in a reduced tillage system. If harvest was late, the effect on E. repens was better when glyphosate was applied in ripe barley or in spring than in late autumn. With reduced tillage more weed seeds were found in 0-10cm soil depth than in 10-20cm soil depth. Different tillage treatments produced smaller differences in the weed seedbank in 1999 than in 1996.},

Twelve nonlinear growth models and its partial derivatives for oil palm yield growth are presented in this study. The parameters are estimated using the Marquardt iterative method of nonlinear regression relating oil palm yield growth data. The best model was selected based on the model performance and it can be used to estimate the oil palm yield at any age of oil palm. This study found that the Gompertz, logistic, log-logistic, Morgan-Mercer-Flodin and Chapman-Richard growth models have the ability for quantifying a growth phenomenon that exhibit a sigmoid pattern over time. Based on the statistical testing and goodness of fit, the best model is the Logistic model and followed by the Gompertz model, Morgan-Mercer-Flodin, Chapman-Richard (with initial stage) and Log-logistic growth models.},

In this article, we apply multifractals to the species-area relationship and species abundance distributions. We highlight two results: first, species abundance distributions collected at different spatial scales may collapse into a single curve after appropriate renormalization, and second, the power-law form of the species-area relationship and the Shannon, Simpson, and Berger-Parker diversity indices belong to a family of equations relating the species number, species abundance, and area through the moments of the species abundance-probability density function. Explicit formulas for these diversity indices, as a function of area, are derived. Methods to obtain the multifractal spectra from a data set are discussed, and an example is shown with data on tree and shrub species collected in a 50-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Finally, we discuss the implications of the multifractal formalism to the relationship between species range and abundance and the relation between the shape of the species abundance distribution and area.},

  volume = {10},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND:The Cox model relies on the proportional hazards (PH) assumption, implying that the factors investigated have a constant impact on the hazard - or risk - over time. We emphasize the importance of this assumption and the misleading conclusions that can be inferred if it is violated; this is particularly essential in the presence of long follow-ups.METHODS:We illustrate our discussion by analyzing prognostic factors of metastases in 979 women treated for breast cancer with surgery. Age, tumour size and grade, lymph node involvement, peritumoral vascular invasion (PVI), status of hormone receptors (HRec), Her2, and Mib1 were considered.RESULTS:Median follow-up was 14 years; 264 women developed metastases. The conventional Cox model suggested that all factors but HRec, Her2, and Mib1 status were strong prognostic factors of metastases. Additional tests indicated that the PH assumption was not satisfied for some variables of the model. Tumour grade had a significant time-varying effect, but although its effect diminished over time, it remained strong. Interestingly, while the conventional Cox model did not show any significant effect of the HRec status, tests provided strong evidence that this variable had a non-constant effect over time. Negative HRec status increased the risk of metastases early but became protective thereafter. This reversal of effect may explain non-significant hazard ratios provided by previous conventional Cox analyses in studies with long follow-ups.CONCLUSIONS:Investigating time-varying effects should be an integral part of Cox survival analyses. Detecting and accounting for time-varying effects provide insights on some specific time patterns, and on valuable biological information that could be missed otherwise.},

  abstract = {We present a parametric family of regression models for interval-censored event-time (survival) data that accomodates both fixed (e.g. baseline) and time-dependent covariates. The model employs a three-parameter family of survival distributions that includes the Weibull, negative binomial, and log-logistic distributions as special cases, and can be applied to data with left, right, interval, or non-censored event times. Standard methods, such as Newton-Raphson, can be employed to estimate the model and the resulting estimates have an asymptotically normal distribution about the true values with a covariance matrix that is consistently estimated by the information function. The deviance function is described to assess model fit and a robust sandwich estimate of the covariance may also be employed to provide asymptotically robust inferences when the model assumptions do not apply. Spline functions may also be employed to allow for non-linear covariates. The model is applied to data from a long-term study of type 1 diabetes to describe the effects of longitudinal measures of glycemia (HbA[IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"$>$) over time (the time-dependent covariate) on the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy (eye disease), an interval-censored event-time outcome.},

Density measurement (stem counts) is one method that is frequently used. However, density measurement of shrub and herbaceous vegetation is time-consuming and costly. As an alternative, the Braun-Blanquet cover-abundance scale was used to analyze vegetation in several ecological studies. Results from one of these studies show that the Braun-Blanquet method requires only one third to one fifth the field time required for the density method. Furthermore, cover-abundance ratings are better suited than density values to elucidate graphically species-environment relationships. For extensive surveys this method provides sufficiently accurate baseline data to allow environmental impact assessment as required by regulatory agencies.},

  abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that the analysis of comparative data from related species should be performed taking into account their phylogenetic relationships. We introduce a new method, based on the use of generalized estimating equations (GEE), for the analysis of comparative data. The principle is to incorporate, in the modelling process, a correlation matrix that specifies the dependence among observations. This matrix is obtained from the phylogenetic tree of the studied species. Using this approach, a variety of distributions (discrete or continuous) can be analysed using a generalized linear modelling framework, phylogenies with multichotomies can be analysed, and there is no need to estimate ancestral character state. A simulation study showed that the proposed approach has good statistical properties with a type-I error rate close to the nominal 5\%, and statistical power to detect correlated evolution between two characters which increases with the strength of the correlation. The proposed approach performs well for the analysis of discrete characters. We illustrate our approach with some data on macro-ecological correlates in birds. Some extensions of the use of GEE are discussed.},

Simultaneous modeling of multiple kinetics requires nonlinear mixed models methodology. To the best of our knowledge, no such curve-fitting approach has been used to analyze multiple V\textperiodcentered{}V\textperiodcentered$\backslash$dot \{$\backslash$mathrm \{V\}\}O2 kinetics in both research and clinical practice so far.MethodsIn the present study, we describe functionality of the R package medrc that extends the framework of the commonly used packages drc and nlme and allows fitting nonlinear mixed effects models for automated nonlinear regression modeling. The methodology was applied to a data set including 6MWT V\textperiodcentered{}V\textperiodcentered$\backslash$dot \{$\backslash$mathrm \{V\}\}O2 kinetics from 61 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (disease severity stage II to IV). The mixed effects approach was compared to a traditional curve-by-curve approach.ResultsA six-parameter nonlinear regression model was jointly fitted to the set of V\textperiodcentered{}V\textperiodcentered$\backslash$dot \{$\backslash$mathrm \{V\}\}O2 kinetics. Significant differences between disease stages were found regarding steady state V\textperiodcentered{}V\textperiodcentered$\backslash$dot \{$\backslash$mathrm \{V\}\}O2 during exercise, V\textperiodcentered{}V\textperiodcentered$\backslash$dot \{$\backslash$mathrm \{V\}\}O2 level after recovery and V\textperiodcentered{}V\textperiodcentered$\backslash$dot \{$\backslash$mathrm \{V\}\}O2 inflection point in the recovery phase. Estimates obtained by the mixed effects approach showed standard errors that were consistently lower as compared to the curve-by-curve approach.ConclusionsHereby we demonstrate the novelty and usefulness of this methodology in the context of physiological exercise testing.},

  abstract = {Bivariate samples may be subject to censoring of both random variables. For example, for two toxins measured in batches of wheat grain, there may be specific detection limits. Alternatively, censoring may be incomplete over a certain domain, with the probability of detection depending on the toxin level. In either case, data are not missing at random, and the missing data pattern bears some information on the parameters of the underlying model (informative missingness), which can be exploited for a fully efficient analysis. Estimation (after suitable data transformation) of the correlation in such samples is the subject of the present paper. We consider several estimators. The first is based on the tetrachoric correlation. It is simple to compute, but does not exploit the full information. The other two estimators exploit all information and use full maximum likelihood, but involve heavier computations. The one assumes fixed detection limits, while the other involves a logistic model for the probability of detection. For a real data set, a logistic model for the probability of detection fitted markedly better than a model with fixed detection limits, suggesting that censoring is not complete.},

However, weed scientists face practical problems in determining the best soil depth at which to calculate it. Two different types of measures are proposed for this: moment-based indices and probability density-based indices. Due to the monitoring process, it is not possible to observe the exact emergence time of every seedling; therefore, emergence times are not observed individually, seedling by seedling, but in an aggregated way. To address these facts, some new methods to estimate the proposed indices are derived, using grouped data estimators and kernel density estimators. The proposed methods have been exemplified with an emergence data set of Bromus diandrus. The results indicate that hydrothermal timing at 50 mm is more useful than that at 10 mm.},

To this aim, an alternative use of fining agents (activated charcoal, PVPP and zeolite) was evaluated. Two levels of ethylphenol contamination were considered: a naturally low contaminated red wine and the same wine spiked with 4-EP and 4-EG. The impact of the treatments on desirable aroma volatiles, polyphenols and colour was also evaluated. The effectiveness in diminishing the intensity of the phenolic off-odour was assessed by descriptive sensory analysis. The activated charcoal and PVPP significantly decreased the concentrations of 4-ethylguaiacol and 4-ethylphenol in the naturally contaminated wine, while none of the tested fining agent was effective in the spiked one. Polyphenols and colour were slightly affected, to the same extent for the two treatments. Charcoal and PVPP additions negatively impacted the concentration of the aroma volatiles, especially esters, with the activated charcoal achieving a higher decrease. The sensory outcome of both treatments was the decrease in the intensity of phenolic off-odour, with charcoal achieving a higher decrease. Interestingly, in spite of the decrease in esters, also a significant increase in the intensity of ``red fruit'' odour occurred.},

In this study a population of Brettanomyces strains isolated from Italian wines was thoroughly investigated to evaluate adaptability to wine conditions and spoilage potential. The presumptive isolates of Brettanomyces were identified at species level with 26S rRNA gene sequencing and species-specific PCR, and subsequently subjected to analysis of intra-species variability through the study of intron splice sites (ISS-PCR). Although, some strains were tracked in wines from different regions, extensive genetic biodiversity was observed within the B. bruxellensis population investigated. All strains were evaluated for their growth ability in the presence of ethanol, high sugar content, low pH, different temperatures and sulphur dioxide, using optical density and flow cytometry measurement. The ability of yeasts to produce ethyl phenols in red wines with different chemical compositions was evaluated by means of high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD). The results highlighted wide variability in B. bruxellensis in response to wine limiting factors and in terms of the accumulation of ethyl phenols. As regards this last aspect, the differences found among strains were closely related to chemical composition of wine and strain resistance to environmental stress factors, making a priori evaluation of risk of wine alteration quite difficult. These results suggest that strategies for the control of Brettanomyces should be tailored on the basis of strain distribution and wine characteristics.},

However, since only the Maximum a Posteriori estimate was computed, the posterior uncertainty about the regularized solution given the measured vibration field, the mechanical model and the regularization parameter was not assessed. To answer this legitimate question, this paper fully exploits the Bayesian framework to provide, from a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, credible intervals and other statistical measures (mean, median, mode) for all the parameters of the force reconstruction problem.},

  abstract = {There is a clear perception in the literature that there is a crisis in reproducibility in the biomedical sciences. Many underlying factors contributing to the prevalence of irreproducible results have been highlighted with a focus on poor design and execution of experiments along with the misuse of statistics. While these factors certainly contribute to irreproducibility, relatively little attention outside of the specialized statistical literature has focused on the expected prevalence of false discoveries under idealized circumstances. In other words, when everything is done correctly, how often should we expect to be wrong? Using a simple simulation of an idealized experiment, it is possible to show the central role of sample size and the related quantity of statistical power in determining the false discovery rate, and in accurate estimation of effect size. According to our calculations, based on current practice many subfields of biomedical science may expect their discoveries to be false at least 25\% of the time, and the only viable course to correct this is to require the reporting of statistical power and a minimum of 80\% power (1 \`A b = 0.80) for all studies.},

  abstract = {Requiring water and minerals to grow and to develop its organs, Maize (Zea mays L.) production and distribution is highly rainfall-dependent. Current global climatic changes reveal irregular rainfall patterns and this could represent for maize a stressing condition resulting in yield and productivity loss around the world. It is well known that low water availability leads the plant to adopt a number of metabolic alterations to overcome stress or reduce its effects. In this regard, selenium (Se), a trace element, can help reduce water damage caused by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here we report the effects of exogenous Se supply on physiological and biochemical processes that may influence yield and quality of maize under drought stress conditions. Plants were grown in soil fertilized by adding 150 mg of Se (sodium selenite). We verified the effects of drought stress and Se treatment. Selenium biofortification proved more beneficial for maize plants when supplied at higher Se concentrations. The increase in proline, K concentrations and nitrogen metabolism in aerial parts of plants grown in Se-rich substrates, seems to prove that Se-biofortification increased plant resistance to water shortage conditions. Moreover, the increase of SeMeSeCys and SeCys2 forms in roots and aerial parts of Se-treated plants suggest resistance strategies to Se similar to those existing in Se-hyperaccumulator species. In addition, epigenetic changes in DNA methylation due to water stress and Se treatment were also investigated using methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP). Results suggest that Se may be an activator of particular classes of genes that are involved in tolerance to abiotic stresses. In particular, PSY (phytoene synthase) gene, essential for maintaining leaf carotenoid contents, SDH (sorbitol dehydrogenase), whose activity regulates the level of important osmolytes during drought stress and ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase), whose activity plays a central role in biochemical adaptation to environmental stress. In conclusion, Se-biofortification could help maize plants to cope with drought stress conditions, by inducing a higher drought tolerance.},

In Europe, P. australis is affected by severe decline (known as Reed Die-Back Syndrome or RDBS); this study aims to understand if in RDBS condition the reproductive strategy of P. australis was altered, based on the hypothesis that if stress occurs, plants are likely to use their energy to increase genetic variability to overcome the stress. Inflorescences in five Italian wetlands were sampled from healthy and RDBS-affected stands of P. australis. Seed production, seed viability and seed germination were evaluated, with germination monitored under two different water conditions: moist and submerged. Stress induced by RDBS appears to influence the reproductive strategy of P. australis. In RDBS-affected stands, seed production was significantly higher than healthy stands for four of five sites. Seed viability and germination were also higher in RDBS-affected stands, but these differences were lower and site dependent.},

MGT does not show the time from the start of imbibition to a specific germination percentage. MGT has been used to compare specific pairs or groups of means and to evaluate seed vigour. However, it is not the real time to mean germination but just an index of germination speed. Using MGT is not correct for ANOVA, post-ANOVA or the other comparison tests, because it does not show time to a specific germination percentage. Thus, we recommend that t50 be used instead of MGT.

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Some lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks occur in Mediterranean Countries. They are still largely unexploited and cause considerable problems due to the lack of cost-effective harvesting, storage and disposal technologies. Recent studies found that some basidiomycetous yeasts are able to accumulate high amount of intracellular lipids for biorefinery processes (i.e., biofuels and biochemicals). Accordingly, the above biomass feedstocks could be used as carbon sources (after their pre-treatment and hydrolysis) for lipid accumulation by oleaginous yeasts.
Results:\hspace{0.6em} Cardoon stalks, stranded driftwood and olive tree pruning residues were pre-treated with steam-explosion and enzymatic hydrolysis for releasing free mono- and oligosaccharides. Lipid accumulation tests were performed at two temperatures (20 and 25 $^\circ$C) using Leucosporidium creatinivorum DBVPG 4794, Naganishia adeliensis DBVPG 5195 and Solicoccozyma terricola DBVPG 5870. S. terricola grown on cardoon stalks at 20 $^\circ$C exhibited the highest lipid production (13.20 g/l), a lipid yield (28.95\%) close to the maximum theoretical value and a lipid composition similar to that found in palm oil. On the contrary, N. adeliensis grown on stranded driftwood and olive tree pruning residues exhibited a lipid composition similar to those of olive and almonds oils. A predictive evaluation of the physical properties of the potential biodiesel obtainable by lipids produced by tested yeast strains has been reported and discussed.
Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Lipids produced by some basidiomycetous yeasts grown on Mediterranean lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks could be used as supplementary sources of oils for producing biofuels and biochemicals.},

RESULTS: Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA ICP-MS) was used for the assessment of mineral composition of table olives. Olive trees were fertilized with sodium selenate before flowering. At harvest, the edible parts of drupes proved to be significantly enriched in Se, delivering 6.1 \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend{}g g-1 (39\% of the RDA for five olives). Such enrichment was followed by significant changes in the concentrations of B, Mg, K, Cr, Mn, Fe and Cu in edible parts, which are discussed for their impact on food quality.
CONCLUSION: The biofortification of olive plants has allowed the enrichment of fruits with selenium. Enrichment with selenium has caused an increase in the concentration of other elements, which can change the nutritional quality of the drupes. The analytical technique used well as a valuable tool for routinely determining the chemical composition of all fruit parts.},

  abstract = {Abstract. This article investigates whether the Braun-Blanquet abundance/dominance (AD) scores that commonly appear in phytosociological tables can properly be analysed by conventional multivariate analysis methods such as Principal Components Analysis and Correspondence Analysis. The answer is a definite NO. The source of problems is that the AD values express species performance on a scale, namely the ordinal scale, on which differences are not interpretable. There are several arguments suggesting that no matter which methods have been preferred in contemporary numerical syntaxonomy and why, ordinal data should be treated in an ordinal way. In addition to the inadmissibility of arithmetic operations with the AD scores, these arguments include interpretability of dissimilarities derived from ordinal data, consistency of all steps throughout the analysis and universality of the method which enables simultaneous treatment of various measurement scales. All the ordination methods that are commonly used, for example, Principal Components Analysis and all variants of Correspondence Analysis as well as standard cluster analyses such as Ward's method and group average clustering, are inappropriate when using AD data. Therefore, the application of ordinal clustering and scaling methods to traditional phytosociological data is advocated. Dissimilarities between relev\'es should be calculated using ordinal measures of resemblance, and ordination and clustering algorithms should also be ordinal in nature. A good ordination example is Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) as long as it is calculated from an ordinal dissimilarity measure such as the Goodman \& Kruskal $\gamma$ coefficient, and for clustering the new OrdClAn-H and OrdClAn-N methods.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Starches are the main storage polysaccharides in plants and are distributed widely throughout plants including seeds, roots, tubers, leaves, stems and so on. Currently, microscopic observation is one of the most important ways to investigate and analyze the structure of starches. The position, shape, and size of the starch granules are the main measurements for quantitative analysis. In order to obtain these measurements, segmentation of starch granules from the background is very important. However, automatic segmentation of starch granules is still a challenging task because of the limitation of imaging condition and the complex scenarios of overlapping granules. RESULTS: We propose a novel method to segment starch granules in microscopic images. In the proposed method, we first separate starch granules from background using automatic thresholding and then roughly segment the image using watershed algorithm. In order to reduce the oversegmentation in watershed algorithm, we use the roundness of each segment, and analyze the gradient vector field to find the critical points so as to identify oversegments. After oversegments are found, we extract the features, such as the position and intensity of the oversegments, and use fuzzy c-means clustering to merge the oversegments to the objects with similar features. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can alleviate oversegmentation of watershed segmentation algorithm successfully. CONCLUSIONS: We present a new scheme for starch granules segmentation. The proposed scheme aims to alleviate the oversegmentation in watershed algorithm. We use the shape information and critical points of gradient vector flow (GVF) of starch granules to identify oversegments, and use fuzzy c-mean clustering based on prior knowledge to merge these oversegments to the objects. Experimental results on twenty microscopic starch images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  title = {Long-Term Crop Yield Data Series: Do They Help Address the Needs Posed by Climate Changes?},
  abstract = {This paper is based on a randomised Long Term Experiment (LTE) in central Italy, which was set-up in 1971 and is still running at present (2016). In this experiment, 13 rotations based on wheat are compared, wherein crop residues are either removed after harvest or buried into the soil at ploughing. This is the follow-up of a previous paper, which, in accordance with the original aims of this research study, concentrated on the agronomic sustainability of the above cropping systems. In this paper, we tried to address the problem of adaptation to climatic changes and concentrated on the resilience of the above cropping systems. The results showed that wheat yield in all cropping systems under study was not 'statically' stable, but it was subjected to strong fluctuations, according to weather conditions. Therefore, cropping systems heavily based on wheat appear not to be resilient, in the sense that they cannot maintain all their functions in case of increased frequency of unfavourable weather events. Data seemed to suggest that the most crucial aspects relate to the amount of rainfall and temperature late in the spring: possible changes of weather pattern in this period may have important consequences on wheat yield. Although this paper represents just a first attempt, it is clear that long-term yield data obtained in agriculture experiments, regardless of their original aims, hold the potential to provide useful information relating to climate changes. In general, exploiting the existent long term yield data to address the resilience of cropping systems may be a crucial issue for future research.},

  abstract = {Seed germination is responsive to diverse environmental, hormonal and chemical signals. Germination rates (i.e. speed and distribution in time) reveal information about timing, uniformity and extent of germination in seed populations and are sensitive indicators of seed vigour and stress tolerance. Population-based threshold (PBT) models have been applied to describe germination responses to temperature, water potential, hormones, ageing and oxygen. However, obtaining detailed data on germination rates of seed populations requires repeated observations at frequent times to construct germination time courses, which is labour intensive and often impractical. Recently, instruments have been developed to measure repeatedly the respiration (oxygen consumption) of individual seeds following imbibition, providing complete respiratory time courses for populations of individual seeds in an automated manner. In this study, we demonstrate a new approach that enables the use of single-seed respiratory data, rather than germination data, to characterize the responses of seed populations to diverse conditions. We applied PBT models to single-seed respiratory data and compared the results to similar analyses of germination time courses. We found consistent and quantitatively comparable relationships between seed respiratory and germination patterns in response to temperature, water potential, abscisic acid, gibberellin, respiratory inhibitors, ageing and priming. This close correspondence between seed respiration and germination time courses enables the use of semi-automated respiratory measurements to assess seed vigour and quality parameters. It also raises intriguing questions about the fundamental relationship between the respiratory capacities of seeds and the rates at which they proceed toward completion of germination.},

  volume = {101},
  abstract = {Time-to-event methods have been proposed in the agricultural sciences, as one of the most suitable options for the analysis of seed germination data. In contrast to traditional linear/nonlinear regression, time-to-event methods can easily account for all statistical peculiarities inherited in germination assays, such as censoring, and they can produce unbiased estimates of model parameters and their standard errors. So far, these methods have only been used in combination with empirical models of germination, which are lacking biological underpinnings. We bridge the gap between statistical requirements and biological understanding by developing a general method that formulates biologically-oriented hydro time (HT), thermal time (TT) and hydrothermal time (HTT) models into a time-to-event framework. HT, TT, and HTT models are widely used for describing seed germination and emergence of plants as affected by the environmental temperature and/or water potential. Owing to their simplicity and the direct biological interpretation of model parameters, these models have become one of the most common tools for both predicting germination as well as understanding the physiology of germination responses to environmental factors. However, these models are usually fitted by using nonlinear regression and, therefore, they fall short of statistical rigor when inference about model parameters is of interest. In this study, we develop HT-to-event, TT-to-event and HTT-to-event models and provide a readily available implementation relying on the package ``drc'' in the R statistical environment. Examples of usage are also provided and we highlight the possible advantages of this procedure, such as efficiency and flexibility.},

In semi-arid Mediterranean areas, inadequate soil warmth delays guar planting to May/early June and harvest to October-November, when high rainfall hinders seed maturation and lowers gum quality. Nine world guar genotypes (from India, Pakistan, USA, South Africa) were tested for germination capability and speed in response to temperature. All source seeds were field grown in Sicily for use in germination assays. The following temperature regimes were imposed adopting a completely randomized design: A) seven constant temperatures from 5$^\circ$C to 35$^\circ$C (5$^\circ$C increments), and B) two alternating temperatures of 15/10$^\circ$C and 20/15$^\circ$C (6h/18h thermoperiod), each consisting of four replicates of 25 seeds. Optimal germination temperatures were always 30 and 35$^\circ$C, but Indian genotypes also demonstrated substantial germination percentages (33-43\%) at constant temperatures as low as 15$^\circ$C. Mean germination time (MGT) of genotypes India2, Kinman, Lewis, and Monument were 1.1 to 1.7 days at 30 and 35$^\circ$C. At lower temperatures (15$^\circ$C), the germination percentage and MGT improved significantly when the seeds were exposed at 20$^\circ$C for 6 hours a day. In particular, Kinman, India2 and Monument gave good results, achieving 80\%, 76\% and 66\% germination, respectively, with MGTs of 5 days. This alternating temperature regime is typical in soil during the Mediterranean spring. Results may be useful both for farmers to identify optimum timing for guar sowing, and for breeders to cross genotypes that tolerate low germination temperatures with high yielding genotypes.},

Problems caused by outliers and by jumps in fertility are tackled via hierarchical-t formulations that may find use in other contexts. The paper includes three analyses of variety trials for yield and one example involving binary data; none is entirely straightforward. Some numerical comparisons with frequentist analyses are made.},

Single-stage analysis is fully efficient, meaning that the estimators can be expected to be as close as possible to the corresponding true genotypic values, and so is often deemed preferable to two-stage analysis. However, two-stage analysis is often favored in practice over singlestage analysis in the case of large datasets because of the larger computational burden of the latter and because the former allows separate analyses of individual trials in the first stage, accounting for any specifics of each trial. In this study we demonstrate the similarities of results of single-stage and twostage analysis when information on mean estimates and the associated variance\textendash{}covariance matrix is forwarded from the first stage to the second stage using four examples with maize (Zea mays L.) trial data from Ethiopia. A new fully efficient and an approximate two-stage method with diagonal weighting matrix are used for weighting in the second stage. We extend the method to three-stage analysis for multienvironment trials when sites are stratified by agro-ecological zones and demonstrate how to obtain best linear unbiased predictions of genotype effects per zone using the information from neighboring zones. Two macros that compute weights for use in the fully efficient and diagonal weighting approaches are provided.},

  abstract = {Crop scientists occasionally compute sample correlations between traits based on observed data from designed experiments, and this is often accompanied by significance tests of the null hypothesis that traits are uncorrelated. This simple approach does not account for effects due to the randomization layout and treatment structure of the experiments and hence statistical inference based on standard procedures is not appropriate. The present paper describes how valid inferences accounting for all relevant effects can be obtained using bivariate mixed linear model procedures. A salient feature of the approach is that the bivariate model is commensurate with the model used for univariate analysis of individual traits and allows bivariate correlations to be computed at the level of effects. Heterogeneity of correlations between effects can be assessed by likelihood ratio tests or by graphical inspection of bivariate scatter plots of effect estimates. if heterogeneity is found to be substantial, it is crucial to focus on the correlation of effects, and usually, the main interest will be in the treatment effects. If heterogeneity is judged to be negligible, the marginal correlation can be estimated from the bivariate model for an overall assessment of association. The proposed methods are illustrated using four examples. Hints are given to alternative routes of analysis accounting for all treatment and design effects such as regression with groups and analysis of covariance.},

  abstract = {An important assumption in the analysis of multienvironment cultivar trials is homogeneity of error and genotype 3 environment interaction variances. When variances are heterogeneous, the best estimators of performance are obtained by weighting inversely to variance components. However, because variances are almost never known and must be estimated, the additional error introduced into the model from estimating many variances may cause weighted estimators to perform poorly. Our objective was to test a Bayesian approach to estimating heterogeneous error and genotype 3 environment interaction variances. A Bayesian model for multienvironment yield trials that includes a linear model for error and genotype 3 environment interaction variances was applied to yield data from the Iowa State University Oat Variety Trial for the years 1997 to 2003. The Bayesian approach revealed that error variances were highly heterogeneous among environments and that genotype 3 environment interaction variances were heterogeneous among environments and genotypes. Incorporation of heterogeneity of variances significantly decreased estimates of marginal error, genotypic, and genotype 3 environment variance components, with the largest change being a reduction in the marginal genotype 3 environment interaction variance. Repeatabilities were higher in the heterogeneous variance model but not at a high level of statistical significance. Genotype-specific estimates of genotype 3 environment interaction variances were correlated with estimated genotypic yields and heading dates, providing biological validity to our estimates of genotype-specific estimators of genotype 3 environment interaction variances as stability estimators.},

  abstract = {We present a new seed dormancy classification scheme for the non-deep level of the class physiological dormancy (PD), which contains six types. Non-deep PD is divided into two sublevels: one for seeds that exhibit a dormancy continuum (types 1, 2 and 3) and the other for those that do not exhibit a dormancy continuum (types 4, 5 and 6). Analysis of previous studies showed that different types of non-deep PD also can be identified using a graphical method. Seeds with a dormancy (D) $\leftrightarrow$ conditional dormancy (CD) $\leftrightarrow$ non-dormancy (ND) cycle have a low germination percentage in the early stages of CD, and during dormancy loss the germination capacity increases. However, seeds with a CD/ND (i.e. D?CD$\leftrightarrow$ND) cycle germinate to a high percentage at a narrow range of temperatures in the early stages of CD. Cardinal temperatures for seeds with either a D/ND or a CD/ND cycle change during dormancy loss: the ceiling temperature increases in seeds with Type 1, the base temperature decreases in seeds with Type 2 and the base and ceiling temperatures decrease and increase, respectively, in seeds with Type 3. Criteria for distinguishing the six types of non-deep PD and models of the temperature functions of seeds with types 1, 2 and 3 with both types of dormancy cycles are presented. The relevancy of our results to modelling the timing of weed seedling emergence is briefly discussed.},

In many respects, Bayesian methods have proven to be vastly superior to more traditional statistical tools, offering the advantage of higher efficiency and of a consistent conceptual basis for dealing with the problem of induction in the presence of uncertainty. This trend is likely to continue in the future, when the way we collect, manipulate and analyse observations and compare them with theoretical models will assume an even more central role in cosmology. This review is an introduction to Bayesian methods in cosmology and astrophysics and recent results in the field. I first present Bayesian probability theory and its conceptual underpinnings, Bayes' Theorem and the role of priors. I discuss the problem of parameter inference and its general solution, along with numerical techniques such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods. I then review the theory and application of Bayesian model comparison, discussing the notions of Bayesian evidence and effective model complexity, and how to compute and interpret those quantities. Recent developments in cosmological parameter extraction and Bayesian cosmological model building are summarized, highlighting the challenges that lie ahead.},

  abstract = {Background and Objective: Individual patient data meta-analysis consists in combining data from all available trials dealing with a therapeutic problem in order to increase the power of statistical analyses. A key issue when analyzing these pooled data sets is intertrial heterogeneity. In survival data, heterogeneity manifests itself either by differing treatment effects between the included trials or by a baseline hazard that differs between studies. One way to investigate and accommodate this heterogeneity is to use models that include random effects.
Methods: We apply this class of models to the Meta-Analysis of Chemotherapy in Head and Neck Cancers, in which strong heterogeneity is exhibited. This meta-analysis pooled 63 trials involving 10,741 patients.
Results: We show that such modeling permits a better understanding of heterogeneity in the MACH-NC data, both from a frequentist and from a Bayesian point of view. In particular, the modeling suggests the presence of two outlying sets of trials whose baseline risk could explain the apparent efficacy or inefficacy of some treatment protocols.
Conclusion: We conclude that this family of random-effects models is a useful tool for exploring heterogeneity in meta-analyses of time-to-event data, and that its features can be applied to a very wide range of studies. \'C 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Thus, efficient communication between researchers and statisticians is important for the development of agricultural knowledge. Many agricultural researchers claim that communication with statisticians is difficult. On the other hand, many statisticians claim that communication with agricultural researchers is not easy either. This being true, such poor communication can be a barrier to efficient agricultural research. The aim of this research is to study this phenomenon. Do agricultural researchers and statisticians see problems in their communication? What kinds of problems are they? I will try to answer these questions based on a study among scientists representing both groups.},

  doi = {10.1198/106186006X133933},
  abstract = {Recursive binary partitioning is a popular tool for regression analysis. Two fundamental problems of exhaustive search procedures usually applied to fit such models have been known for a long time: overfitting and a selection bias towards covariates with many possible splits or missing values. While pruning procedures are able to solve the overfitting problem, the variable selection bias still seriously affects the interpretability of tree-structured regression models. For some special cases unbiased procedures have been suggested, however lacking a common theoretical foundation. We propose a unified framework for recursive partitioning which embeds tree-structured regression models into a well defined theory of conditional inference procedures. Stopping criteria based on multiple test procedures are implemented and it is shown that the predictive performance of the resulting trees is as good as the performance of established exhaustive search procedures. It turns out that the partitions and therefore the models induced by both approaches are structurally different, confirming the need for an unbiased variable selection. Moreover, it is shown that the prediction accuracy of trees with early stopping is equivalent to the prediction accuracy of pruned trees with unbiased variable selection. The methodology presented here is applicable to all kinds of regression problems, including nominal, ordinal, numeric, censored as well as multivariate response variables and arbitrary measurement scales of the covariates. Data from studies on glaucoma classification, node positive breast cancer survival and mammography experience are re-analyzed.},

  abstract = {The party package (Hothorn, Hornik, and Zeileis 2006) provides the function mob() implementing a recently suggested algorithm for model-based recursive partitioning (Zeileis, Hothorn, and Hornik 2008). The basic steps are: (1) fit a parametric model to a data set, (2) test for parameter instability over a set of partitioning variables, (3) if there is some overall parameter instability, split the model with respect to the variable associated with the highest instability, (4) repeat the procedure in each of the child nodes. It is discussed how these steps of the conceptual algorithm are translated into computational tools in an object-oriented manner, allowing the user to plug in various types of parametric models. The outcome is a tree where each node is associated with a fitted parametric model that can be effectively visualized and summarized.},

  abstract = {Foliar fertilization with selenium (Se) may well be beneficial in increasing the nutritional and qualitative values of food in Se-deficient regions such as the Mediterranean Basin, and may contribute to an increase in drought resistance in plants. The present study has considered detachment force, flesh firmness, pigmentation, fresh and dry weight, and oil content of olive drupes from Se fertilized olive orchards (Olea europaea L.) under drought stress and well-watered conditions. This study has also evaluated the total Se, Se amino acid, phenol, carotenoid and chlorophyll contents of EVOO, plus its oxidative stability against oxidation. While there was no change in the ripening indexes and the production of olives generally, Se application did increase the total Se, Se methionine, phenol, and carotenoid and chlorophyll contents. The higher concentration of these (bio) chemical compounds in EVOO obtained from Se fertilized plants might well suggest enhanced antioxidant activity. Consequently, EVOO obtained from Se fertilized trees possesses a higher nutritional value and, as indicated by the greater oxidative stability against oxidation, longer shelf life. In addition, under water deficient conditions, a higher fresh olive weight corresponds to a higher level of phenol, carotenoid and chlorophyll, and the chlorophyll-to-carotenoid ratio in Se fertilized trees would appear to confirm the positive role of selenium in alleviating damage caused by drought stress conditions.},
