I have been always fond of science. I got my degree in Agricultural Sciences in 1987 and I like to think of  myself as an applied biologist. When I started doing research (in 1990) I was very much fascinated by the idea that natural phenomena might be described, interpreted and understood by using the universal language of math. My PhD studies revolved around nonlinear regression analyses and, afterwards, I've been mainly involved with biostatistics, data analyses and modelling. I do think that biostatistics is fundamental in developing scientific thinking. I lately discovered that teaching biologists requires great care and a very simple language.
