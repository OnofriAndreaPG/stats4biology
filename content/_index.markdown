# MODELS ARE WRONG...

## _...but some are useful (G. Box)_

Hi, all!

This is my statistics blog. "What's new then?", you might say. "There's plenty of them, out there!". Yes, that's right. However, the new thing is that I am not a statistician. I am an applied biologist who happened to be fascinated by the idea that natural phenomena might be described, interpreted and understood by using the universal language of math. Since then, Iâ€™ve been mainly involved with experimental design and data analyses. Indeed, I turned myself into an applied statistician...

I do think that biostatistic is a fundamental component of science: and it is reaching researcmore reliable conclusions, though it is just a mean, not our final interest! Though my language might be rough and overly simplistic, hope it helps reach my aims: help biologists to reach a better awareness of the potential usefulness and limits of statistics.
