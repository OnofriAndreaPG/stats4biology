This is my first day at work with blogdown. I must admit it is pretty overwhelming at the beginning ... 

I thought that it might be useful to write down a few notes, to summarise my steps ahead, during the learning process. I do not work with blogdown everyday and I tend to forget things quite easily. Therefore, these notes may help me recap how far I have come. And they might also help other beginners, to speed up their initial steps with such a powerful blogging platform.

You'll find my notes [here](/articles/blogdownSteps/); I'll try to keep them updated.

Happy reading!
