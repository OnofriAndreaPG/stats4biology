<h1>Exploring the results of a time-to-event fit: model parameters</h1>
<p>In the previous post we have shown that time-to-event curves (e.g., germination or emergence curves) can be used to describe the time course of germinations/emergences for a seed lot (<a href="https://www.statforbiology.com/2021/stat_drcte_4-time-to-eventcurves/">this post</a>). We have also seen that the effects of experimental factors on seed germination can be accounted for by coding a different time-to-event curve for each factor level (<a href="https://www.statforbiology.com/2021/stat_drcte_5-comparinglots/">this post</a>).</p>
<p>Once we have fit a time-to-event model, we are usually interested in exploring the results, to get all possible information from the fitted model. If we have fitted a parametric model, the value of the estimated parameters is usually of extreme interest, as it gives information on the main traits of germination/emergence (e.g., capability, speed and uniformity).</p>
<p>For example, let’s consider the hydro-time model we have fitted in our previous post <a href="https://www.statforbiology.com/2022/stat_drcte_6-ht1step/">at this link</a>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P(t, \Psi) = \Phi \left\{ \frac{\Psi - (\theta_H / t) -\Psi_b }{\sigma_{\Psi_b}} \right\}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is the cumulative proportion of germinated seeds at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and water potential <span class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> is a gaussian cumulative distribution function for base water potential, <span class="math inline">\(\Psi_{b}\)</span> is the median base water potential in the seed lot (in MPa), <span class="math inline">\(\theta_H\)</span> is the hydro-time constant (in MPa day or MPa hour) and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\Psi_b}\)</span> represents the variability of <span class="math inline">\(\Psi_b\)</span> within the population. Clearly, these parameters have a clear biological meaning and getting to know about their value represents the reason why we have fitted such a model. The box below shows the code we used in our previous post:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(drcSeedGerm)
library(drcte)
data(rape)
modHTE &lt;- drmte(nSeeds ~ timeBef + timeAf + Psi, 
                data = rape, fct = HTnorm())
coef(modHTE)
##    ThetaH:(Intercept)    Psib50:(Intercept) sigmaPsib:(Intercept) 
##             0.7510691            -0.9069810             0.2369954</code></pre>
<p>Indeed, we got parameter estimates, but we are not happy with this. We also need standard errors, to present along with estimates in our papers. The easiest way to obtain parameters and their standard errors altogether is to use the <code>summary()</code> method for ‘drcte’ objects:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(modHTE)
## 
## Model fitted: Hydrotime model with normal distribution of Psib (Bradford et al., 2002)
## 
## Robust estimation: no 
## 
## Parameter estimates:

<p>Unfortunately, the above standard errors are not correct: indeed, they are obtained assuming that the observational units (i.e., the seeds) are independent, while they are clustered within randomisation units (Petri dishes, in this case). Consequently, seeds in the same Petri dish are more similar than seeds in different Petri dishes (there is intra-class correlation, we say). How can we obtain standard errors that account for such lack of independence?</p>
<p>If we look at the literature about survival analysis (that is where we borrowed our methods from), we can see that cluster robust sandwich estimators of standard errors have proven useful and reliable (Yu and Peng, 2008). Therefore, we have implemented them in ‘drcte’; the ‘units’ argument in the <code>summary()</code> method can be used to provide a variable for the Petri dishes and calculate cluster-robust SEs, by way of the facilities provided in the ‘sandwich’ package (Zeileis et al. 2020).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(modHTE, robust = T, units = Dish)

<p>We see that the difference between ‘naive’ and cluster robust SEs is remarkable.</p>
<p>There might be other methods to obtain cluster robust standard errors (e.g., jackknife and bootstrap methods) and we are looking for ways to implement them in a reliable way. So far, we recommend that you make sure that your standard errors for model parameters do not neglect the clustering of seeds within randomisation units (petri dishes, pots, boxes or plots).</p>
