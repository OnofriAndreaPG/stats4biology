In a recent paper we wrote the following sentence: "*On average, the A population emerged in 12.4 days, while the B population emerged in 10.6 days and such a difference was not significant (P = 0.71)*". Perhaps I should point out that we were talking about seeds... The reviewer complained that "*This is an example of expression having no place in a scientific paper*"  and that we should write "*... no difference in time to emergence was found between A and B (P = 0.71)*".
