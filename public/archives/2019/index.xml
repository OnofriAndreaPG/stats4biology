      <description>We all work with data frames and it is important that we know how we can reshape them, as necessary to meet our needs. I think that there are, at least, four routine tasks that we need to be able to accomplish:
subsetting sorting casting melting  Obviously, there is a wide array of possibilities; I’ll just mention a few, which I regularly use.
Subsetting the data Subsetting means selecting the records (rows) or the variables (columns) which satisfy certain criteria.</description>

      <title>Drowning in a glass of water: variance-covariance and correlation matrices</title>

      <description>One of the easiest tasks in R is to get correlations between each pair of variables in a dataset. As an example, let’s take the first four columns in the ‘mtcars’ dataset, that is available within R. Getting the variances-covariances and the correlations is straightforward.
data(mtcars) matr &amp;lt;- mtcars[,1:4] #Covariances cov(matr) ## mpg cyl disp hp ## mpg 36.324103 -9.172379 -633.0972 -320.7321 ## cyl -9.172379 3.189516 199.6603 101.9315 ## disp -633.</description>

      <description>A measure of joint variability In statistics, dependence or association is any statistical relationship, whether causal or not, between two random variables or bivariate data. It is often measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient:
\[\rho _{X,Y} =\textrm{corr} (X,Y) = \frac {\textrm{cov}(X,Y) }{ \sigma_X \sigma_Y } = \frac{ \sum_{1 = 1}^n [(X - \mu_X)(Y - \mu_Y)] }{ \sigma_X \sigma_Y }\]
Other measures of correlation can be thought of, such as the Spearman \(\rho\) rank correlation coefficient or Kendall \(\tau\) rank correlation coefficient.</description>

      <title>Some useful equations for nonlinear regression in R</title>

      <description>Introduction Very rarely, biological processes follow linear trends. Just think about how a crop grows, or responds to increasing doses of fertilisers/xenobiotics. Or think about how an herbicide degrades in the soil, or about the germination pattern of a seed population. It is very easy to realise that curvilinear trends are far more common than linear trends. Furthermore, asymptotes and/or inflection points are very common in nature. We can be sure: linear equations in biology are just a way to approximate a response over a very narrow range for the independent variable.</description>
