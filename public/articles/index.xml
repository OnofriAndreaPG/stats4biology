&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very rarely, biological processes follow linear trends. Just think about how a crop grows, or responds to increasing doses of fertilisers/xenobiotics. Or think about how an herbicide degrades in the soil, or about the germination pattern of a seed population. It is very easy to realise that curvilinear trends are far more common than linear trends. Furthermore, asymptotes and/or inflection points are very common in nature. We can be sure: linear equations in biology are just a way to approximate a response over a very narrow range for the independent variable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My learning path with blogdown</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my first day at work with blogdown. I must admit it is pretty overwhelming at the beginning &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked with R Studio and installed the library &amp;lsquo;blogdown&amp;rsquo;. I followed the instructions and used the &amp;lsquo;NEW PROJECT&amp;rsquo; menu and added a &amp;lsquo;NEW BLOGDOWN SITE&amp;rsquo; to my file system. I selected the &amp;lsquo;hugo-blog-jeffprod&amp;rsquo; theme. This created a bunch of directories in my working directory. If I use the &amp;lsquo;serve_site()&amp;rsquo; function in console, the Hugo server is called and the site is continuously updated, as soon as I make changes and save them. When the server is started, a message appears, saying: &amp;ldquo;Serving the directory PROJECTDIR at http://127.0.0.1:7958&amp;rdquo;. I copied the http address on Safari (I am working on Mac OS&amp;hellip;), so that I can check my changes there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
