We are very much used to representing temperature and rainfall data in one single graph with two y-axis, which gives a good immediate insight on the weather pattern at a certain location.

                            <p><p>Pairwise comparisons are one of the most debated topic in agricultural research: they are very often used and, sometimes, abused, in literature. I have nothing against the appropriate use of this very useful technique and, for those who are interested, some colleagues and I have given a bunch of (hopefully) useful suggestions in a paper, a few years ago (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2009.00758.x">follow this link here</a>).</p>
<p>According to the emails I often receive, there might be some interest in making pairwise comparisons in linear/nonlinear regression models. In particular, whenever we have grouped data and we have fitted the same model to each group, we might like to compare the groups, to state whether the regression lines/curves are significantly different from each other. To this aim, we could consider two approaches:</p>...</p>

Apart from this fully crossed structure, we need to introduce, at least, an untreated control and a hand-weeded control. The design for such an experiment has been termed ‘augmented factorial’, because we are, indeed, including some extra treatment levels beyond the crossed factorial structure.</p>...</p>

<p>Repeated measures and subsampling are vastly different: in the first case I am specifically interested in the ‘evolution’ of the response over time (or space, sometimes). In the second case (subsampling), I only want to improve the precision/accuracy of my measurements, by taking multiple random samples in each plot.</p>...</p>

Indeed, apart from counts and proportions, where GLMs can be very useful, I have not yet found a simple way to deal with heteroscedasticity for continuous variables, such as yield, weight, height and so on. Yes, I know, Generalised Least Squares (GLS) can be useful to fit heteroscedastic models, but I would argue that stabilising transformations are, conceptually, very much simpler and they can be easily thought to PhD students and practitioners, with only a basic level of knowledge about statistics.</p>...</p>

<p>My colleague’s research study was similar to this one: a randomised block field experiment (three replicates) with 16 durum wheat genotypes, which was repeated in four years. The quality of grain yield was assessed by recording the following four traits:</p>...</p>

                            <p><p>In a recent post we have seen that we can use Principal Component Analyses (PCA) to elucidate the ‘genotype by environment’ relationship (<a href="https://www.statforbiology.com/2023/stat_met_ammi/">see this post</a>). Whenever the starting point for PCA is the doubly-centered (centered by rows and columns) matrix of yields across environments, we talk about AMMI analysis, which is often used to get insight into the stability of genotype yields across environments.</p>
<p>By changing the starting matrix, we can obtain a different perspective and put focus on the definition of macroenvironments and on the selection of winning genotypes. In particular, if the two-way matrix of yields across environments is only column-centered before PCA, we talk about GGE analysis (Yan et al., 2000). In spite of some academic debate (see Gauch, 2006, Yan et al., 2007, Gauch et al., 2008), AMMI and GGE analyses are both useful and can be used as two complementary tools for the analysis of multi-environment genotype data.</p>...</p>

                            <p><p>Again into a subject that is rather important for most agronomists, i.e. the selection of crop varieties. All farmers are perfectly aware that crop performances are affected both by the genotype and by the environment. These two effects are not purely additive and they often show a significant interaction. By this word, we mean that a genotype can give particularly good/bad performances in some specific environmental situations, which we may not expect, considering its average behaviour in other environmental conditions. The Genotype by Environment (GE) interaction may cause changes in the ranking of genotypes, depending on the environment and may play a key role in varietal recommendation, for a given mega-environment.</p>...</p>

                            <p><p>Subsampling is very common in field experiments in agriculture. It happens when we collect several random samples from each plot and we submit them to some sort of measurement process. Some examples? Let’s imagine that we have randomised field experiments with three replicates and, either,:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>we collect the whole grain yield in each plot, select four subsamples and measure, in each subsample, the oil content or some other relevant chemical property, or</li>
<li>we collect, from each plot, four plants and measure their heights, or</li>
<li>we collect a representative soil sample from each plot and perform chemical analyses in triplicate.</li>
</ol>
<p>For all the above examples, we end up with 3 by 4 equal 12 data for each treatment level. The question is: do we have 12 replicates? This is exactly the point: <strong>subsamples should never be mistaken for true-replicates, as the experimental treatments were not independently allocated to each one of them</strong>. In literature, subsamples are usually known as sub-replicates or pseudo-replicates: for the above examples, we have three true-replicates and four pseudo-replicates per true-replicate. Let’s see how to handle pseudo-replicates in data analysis. But, first of all, do not forget that: <strong>experiments with pseudo-replicates are valid only when we also have true-replicates!</strong> If we only have pseudo-replicates… well, there is nothing we can do in data analysis that transforms our experiment into a valid one…</p>...</p>

<h1>Germination assay</h1>
<p>This dataset was obtained from previously published work (Mesgaran et al., 2017) with <em>Hordeum spontaneum</em> [C. Koch] Thell. The germination assay was conducted using four replicates of 20 seeds tested at six different water potential levels (0, −0.3, −0.6, −0.9, −1.2 and −1.5 MPa). Osmotic potentials were produced using variable amount of polyethylene glycol (PEG, molecular weight 8000) adjusted for the temperature level. Petri dishes were incubated at six constant temperature levels (8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 28 °C), under a photoperiod of 12 h. Germinated seeds (radicle protrusion &gt; 3 mm) were counted and removed daily for 20 days.</p>...</p>

<h1>A motivating examples</h1>
<p>In recent times, we wanted to model the effect of temperature on seed germination for <em>Hordeum vulgare</em> and we made an assay with three replicated Petri dishes (50 seeds each) at 9 constant temperature levels (1, 3, 7, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 °C). Germinated seeds were counted and removed daily for 10 days. This unpublished dataset is available as <code>barley</code> in the <code>drcSeedGerm</code> package, which needs to be installed from github (see below), together with the <code>drcte</code> package for time-to-event model fitting.

                            <p><p>We often use the <strong>coefficient of determination</strong> as a swift ‘measure’ of goodness of fit for our regression models. Unfortunately, there is no unique symbol for such a coefficient and both <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r^2\)</span> are used in literature, almost interchangeably. Such an interchangeability is also endorsed by the Wikipedia (see at: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination</a> ), where both symbols are reported as the abbreviations for this statistical index.</p>
<p>As an editor of several International Journals, I should not agree with such an approach; indeed, the two symbols <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r^2\)</span> mean two different things, and they are not necessarily interchangeable, because, depending on the setting, either of the two may be wrong or ambiguous.

<h1>Motivating example</h1>
<p>Let’s think of a field experiment, where 6 genotypes of faba bean were compared under two different sowing times (autumn and spring). For the ease of organisation, such an experiment was laid down as a <strong>split-plot</strong>, in a randomised complete block design; sowing times were randomly allocated to main-plots, while genotypes were randomly allocated to sub-plots. Let’s stop for a moment… does this sound strange to you? Do you need further information about split-plot designs?

However, I have recently discovered that meta-analytic methods can also be used to analyse the results of a single research project. That happened a few months ago, when I was reading a paper from Damesa et al. (2017), where the authors describe some interesting methods of data analyses for multi-environment genotype experiments. These authors gave a few nice examples with related SAS code, that is rooted in mixed models. As an R enthusiast, I was willing to reproduce their analyses with R, but I could not succeed, until I realised that I could make use of the package ‘metafor’ and its bunch of meta-analityc methods.</p>...</p>

<h1>Comparing germination/emergence for several seed lots</h1>
<p>Very often, seed scientists need to compare the germination behavior of different seed populations, e.g., different plant species, or one single plant species submitted to different temperatures, light conditions, priming treatments and so on. How should such a comparison be performed? For example, if we have submitted several seed samples to different environmental conditions, how do we decide whether the germinative response is affected by those environmental conditions?</p>...</p>

<h1>Time-to-event models for seed germination/emergence</h1>
<p>The individual seeds within a population do not germinate/emerge altogether at the same moment; this is an undisputed fact, resulting from seed-to-seed variability in germination/emergence time. Accordingly, the primary reason why we organise germination assays is to describe the progress to germination for the whole population, by using some appropriate time-to-event model.</p>...</p>

                            <p><p>In this post I am revisiting the concept of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). You might say that there is no need for that, as the Internet is full with posts relating to such a rather old technique. However, I feel that, in those posts, the theoretical aspects are either too deeply rooted in maths or they are skipped altogether, so that the main emphasis is on interpreting the output of an R function. I think that both approaches may not be suitable for biologists: the first one may be too difficult to understand, while skipping altogether the theoretical aspects promotes the use of R as a black-box, which is dangerouse for teaching purposes. That’s why I wrote this post… I wanted to make my attempt to create a useful lesson. You will tell me whether I suceeded or not.</p>...</p>

<p>Germination/emergence assays are relatively easy to perform, by following standardised procedures, as described, e.g., by the International Seed Testing Association (<a href="https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ista/rules/2019/00002019/00000001">see here</a> ). In short, we take a sample of seeds and we put them in an appropriate container. We put the container in the right environmental conditions (e.g., relating to humidity content and temperature) and we inspect the seeds according to a regular schedule (e.g., daily). At each inspection, we count the number of germinated/emerged seeds and remove them from the containers; inspections are performed until no new germinations/emergences are observed for a sufficient amount of time.</p>...</p>

<p>In this post I’ll tell you about a recent situation where I was involved with derivatives. A few weeks ago, a colleague of mine wrote me to ask the following question (I’m changing it a little, to make it, hopefully, more interesting). He asked: <em>“I am using a power curve to model how the size of the sampling area affects species richness. How can I quantify my knowledge gain?”</em>. This is an interesting question, indeed, although I feel I should provide you with some background information.</p>...</p>

                            <p><p>Making sure that a fitted model gives a good description of the observed data is a fundamental step of every nonlinear regression analysis. To this aim we can (and should) use several techniques, either graphical or based on formal hypothesis testing methods. However, in the end, I must admit that I often feel the need of displaying a simple index, based on a single and largely understood value, that reassures the readers about the goodness of fit of my models.</p>...</p>

<p>In a previous post, I already mentioned that, due to my age, I see myself as a dinosaur within the R-users community. I already mentioned how difficult it is, for a dinosaur, to adjust to new concepts and paradigms in data analysis, after having done things differently for a long time ( <a href="https://www.statforbiology.com/2020/stat_r_tidyverse_columnwise/">see this post here</a> ). Today, I decided to sit and write a second post, relating to data analyses for split-plot designs. Some years ago, when switching to R, this topic required some adjustments to my usual workflow, which gave me a few headaches.</p>...</p>

                            <p><p>Pairwise comparisons are one of the most debated topic in agricultural research: they are very often used and, sometimes, abused, in literature. I have nothing against the appropriate use of this very useful technique and, for those who are interested, some colleagues and I have given a bunch of (hopefully) useful suggestions in a paper, a few years ago (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2009.00758.x">follow this link here</a>).</p>
<p>Pairwise comparisons usually follow the application of some sort of linear or generalised linear model; in this setting, the ‘emmeans’ package (Lenth, 2020) is very handy, as it uses a very logical approach. However, we can find ourselves in the need of making pairwise comparisons between the elements of a vector, which does not came as the result of linear model fitting.</p>...</p>

Ultimately, that statement is true: when I have fully understood a model with all its components (and thus I have become a modeler), I can very logically translate it to BUGS code. The drawback is that, very often, the final coding appears to be rather ‘problem-specific’ and difficult to be reused in other situations, without an extensive editing work.</p>...</p>

                            <p><p>In this post, I am going to talk about an issue that is often overlooked by agronomists and biologists. The point is that field experiments are very often laid down in blocks, using split-plot designs, strip-plot designs or other types of designs with grouping factors (blocks, main-plots, sub-plots). We know that these grouping factors should be appropriately accounted for in data analyses: ‘analyze them as you have randomized them’ is a common saying attributed to Ronald Fisher. Indeed, observations in the same group are correlated, as they are more alike than observations in different groups. What happens if we neglect the grouping factors? We break the independence assumption and our inferences are invalid (Onofri et al., 2010).</p>...</p>

If you are interested, you can take a look <a href="https://rdcu.be/caxZh">here at this link</a>.</p>
<p>Diallel experiments are based on a set of possible crosses between some homozygous (inbred) lines. For example, if we have the male lines A, B and C and the female lines A, B and C (same lines used, alternatively, as male and female), we would have the following selfed parents: AA, BB and CC and the following crosses: AB, AC, BC. In some instances, we might also have the reciprocals BA, CA and CB. Selfed parents and crosses are compared on a Randomised Complete Block Design, usually replicated across seasons and/or locations.</p>...</p>

<p>QQ-plots and Box-Whisker plots usually become part of the statistical toolbox for the students attending my course of ‘Experimental methods in agriculture’. Most of them learn that the QQ-plot can be used to check for the basic assumption of gaussian residuals in linear models and that the Box-Whisker plot can be used to describe the experimental groups, when their size is big enough and we do not want to assume a gaussian distribution. Furthermore, most students learn to use the <code>plot()</code> method on an ‘lm’ object and the <code>boxplot()</code> function in the base ‘graphic’ package and concentrate on the interpretation of the R output. To me, in practical terms, this is enough; however, there is at least a couple of students per year who think that this is not enough and they want to know more. What is the math behind those useful plots? Can we draw them by hand?</p>...</p>

<h1>What are long-term experiments?</h1>
<p>Agricultural experiments have to deal with long-term effects of cropping practices. Think about fertilisation: certain types of organic fertilisers may give effects on soil fertility, which are only observed after a relatively high number of years (say: 10-15). In order to observe those long-term effects, we need to plan Long Term Experiments (LTEs), wherein each plot is regarded as a small cropping system, with the selected combination of rotation, fertilisation, weed control and other cropping practices. Due to the fact that yield and other relevant variables are repeatedly recorded over time, LTEs represent a particular class of multi-environment experiments with repeated measures.</p>...</p>

It is widely known that the yield of a genotype in different environments depends on environmental covariates, such as the amount of rainfall in some critical periods of time.

<p>I am locked at home, due to the COVID-19 emergency in Italy. Luckily I am healthy, but there is not much to do, inside. I thought it might be nice to spend some time to talk about seed germination models and the connections with survival analysis.</p>
<p>We all know that seeds need water to germinate. Indeed, the absorption of water activates the hydrolytic enzymes, which break down food resources stored in seeds and provide energy for germination. As the consequence, there is a very close relationship between water content in the substrate and germination velocity: the higher the water content the quickest the germination, as long as the availability of oxygen does not become a problem (well, water and oxygen in soil may compete for space and a high water content may result in oxygen shortage).</p>...</p>

While I often use the ‘drm()’ function in the ‘drc’ package for my research work, I tend to prefer the ‘nls()’ function for teaching purposes, mainly because, in my opinion, the transition from linear models to nonlinear models is smoother, for beginners. One problem with ‘nls()’ is that, in contrast to ‘drm()’, it is not specifically tailored to the needs of biologists or students in biology. Therefore, now and then, I have to build some helper functions, to perform some specific tasks; I usually share these functions within the ‘aomisc’ package, that is available on github (<a href="https://www.statforbiology.com/rpackages/">see this link</a>).</p>...</p>

<p>Factorial experiments are very common in agriculture and they are usually laid down to test for the significance of interactions between experimental factors. For example, genotype assessments may be performed at two different nitrogen fertilisation levels (e.g. high and low) to understand whether the ranking of genotypes depends on nutrient availability. For those of you who are not very much into agriculture, I will only say that such an assessment is relevant, because we need to know whether we can recommend the same genotypes, e.g., both in conventional agriculture (high nitrogen availability) and in organic agriculture (relatively lower nitrogen availability).</p>...</p>

<p>Let’s take a practical approach and start from an appropriate example: a few years ago, some collegues studied the germination behaviour for seeds of a plant species (<em>Verbascum arcturus</em>, BTW…), in different conditions. In detail, they considered the factorial combination of two storage periods (LONG and SHORT storage) and two temperature regimes (FIX: constant daily temperature of 20°C; ALT: alternating daily temperature regime, with 25°C during daytime and 15°C during night time, with a 12:12h photoperiod). If you are a seed scientist and are interested in this experiment, you’ll find detail in Catara <em>et al.</em> (2016).</p>...</p>

<p>Seed germination data describe the time until an event of interest occurs. In this sense, they are very similar to survival data, apart from the fact that we deal with a different (and less sad) event: germination instead of death. But, seed germination data are also similar to failure-time data, phenological data, time-to-remission data… the first point is: <strong>germination data are time-to-event data</strong>.</p>
<p>You may wonder: what’s the matter with time-to-event data? Do they have anything special? With few exceptions, all time-to-event data are affected by a certain form of uncertainty, which takes the name of ‘censoring’. It relates to the fact that the exact time of event may not be precisely know. I think it is good to give an example.</p>...</p>

                            <p><p>ANOVA is routinely used in applied biology for data analyses, although, in some instances, the basic assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity of residuals do not hold. In those instances, most biologists would be inclined to adopt some sort of stabilising transformations (logarithm, square root, arcsin square root…), prior to ANOVA. Yes, there might be more advanced and elegant solutions, but stabilising transformations are suggested in most traditional biometry books, they are very straightforward to apply and they do not require any specific statistical software. I do not think that this traditional technique should be underrated.</p>...</p>

                            <p><p>Yield stability is a fundamental aspect for the selection of crop genotypes. The definition of stability is rather complex (see, for example, Annichiarico, 2002); in simple terms, the yield is stable when it does not change much from one environment to the other. It is an important trait, that helps farmers to maintain a good income in most years.</p>
<p>Agronomists and plant breeders are continuosly concerned with the assessment of genotype stability; this is accomplished by planning genotype experiments, where a number of genotypes is compared on randomised complete block designs, with three to five replicates. These experiments are repeated in several years and/or several locations, in order to measure how the environment influences yield level and the ranking of genotypes.</p>...</p>

                            <p><p>With field experiments, studying the correlation between the observed traits may not be an easy task. Indeed, in these experiments, subjects are not independent, but they are grouped by treatment factors (e.g., genotypes or weed control methods) or by blocking factors (e.g., blocks, plots, main-plots). I have dealt with this problem <a href="https://www.statforbiology.com/2019/stat_general_correlationindependence1/">in a previous post</a> and I gave a solution based on traditional methods of data analyses.</p>
<p>In a recent paper, Piepho (2018) proposed a more advanced solution based on mixed models. He presented four examplary datasets and gave SAS code to analyse them, based on PROC MIXED. I was very interested in those examples, but I do not use SAS. Therefore, I tried to ‘transport’ the models in R, which turned out to be a difficult task. After struggling for awhile with several mixed model packages, I came to an acceptable solution, which I would like to share.</p>...</p>
