                            <p><p>Pairwise comparisons are one of the most debated topic in agricultural research: they are very often used and, sometimes, abused, in literature. I have nothing against the appropriate use of this very useful technique and, for those who are interested, some colleagues and I have given a bunch of (hopefully) useful suggestions in a paper, a few years ago (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2009.00758.x">follow this link here</a>).</p>
<p>According to the emails I often receive, there might be some interest in making pairwise comparisons in linear/nonlinear regression models. In particular, whenever we have grouped data and we have fitted the same model to each group, we might like to compare the groups, to state whether the regression lines/curves are significantly different from each other. To this aim, we could consider two approaches:</p>...</p>

                            <p><p>We often use the <strong>coefficient of determination</strong> as a swift ‘measure’ of goodness of fit for our regression models. Unfortunately, there is no unique symbol for such a coefficient and both <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r^2\)</span> are used in literature, almost interchangeably. Such an interchangeability is also endorsed by the Wikipedia (see at: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination</a> ), where both symbols are reported as the abbreviations for this statistical index.</p>
<p>As an editor of several International Journals, I should not agree with such an approach; indeed, the two symbols <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r^2\)</span> mean two different things, and they are not necessarily interchangeable, because, depending on the setting, either of the two may be wrong or ambiguous.

<h1>Comparing germination/emergence for several seed lots</h1>
<p>Very often, seed scientists need to compare the germination behavior of different seed populations, e.g., different plant species, or one single plant species submitted to different temperatures, light conditions, priming treatments and so on. How should such a comparison be performed? For example, if we have submitted several seed samples to different environmental conditions, how do we decide whether the germinative response is affected by those environmental conditions?</p>...</p>

                            <p><p>In general, undergraduate students in biology/ecology courses tend to consider the derivatives as a very abstract entity, with no real usefulness in the everyday life. In my work as a teacher, I have often tried to fight against such an attitude, by providing convincing examples on how we can use the derivatives to get a better understanding about the changes on a given system.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll tell you about a recent situation where I was involved with derivatives. A few weeks ago, a colleague of mine wrote me to ask the following question (I’m changing it a little, to make it, hopefully, more interesting). He asked: <em>“I am using a power curve to model how the size of the sampling area affects species richness. How can I quantify my knowledge gain?”</em>. This is an interesting question, indeed, although I feel I should provide you with some background information.</p>...</p>

<p>But, … what are threshold models? In some instances, we need to describe relationships where the response variable changes abruptly, following a small change in the predictor. A typical threshold model looks like that in the Figure below, where we see three threshold levels:</p>...</p>

<p>Pairwise comparisons usually follow the application of some sort of linear or generalised linear model; in this setting, the ‘emmeans’ package (Lenth, 2020) is very handy, as it uses a very logical approach. However, we can find ourselves in the need of making pairwise comparisons between the elements of a vector, which does not came as the result of linear model fitting.</p>...</p>

                            <p><p>In this post, I am going to talk about an issue that is often overlooked by agronomists and biologists. The point is that field experiments are very often laid down in blocks, using split-plot designs, strip-plot designs or other types of designs with grouping factors (blocks, main-plots, sub-plots). We know that these grouping factors should be appropriately accounted for in data analyses: ‘analyze them as you have randomized them’ is a common saying attributed to Ronald Fisher. Indeed, observations in the same group are correlated, as they are more alike than observations in different groups. What happens if we neglect the grouping factors? We break the independence assumption and our inferences are invalid (Onofri et al., 2010).</p>...</p>

<p>I am locked at home, due to the COVID-19 emergency in Italy. Luckily I am healthy, but there is not much to do, inside. I thought it might be nice to spend some time to talk about seed germination models and the connections with survival analysis.</p>
<p>We all know that seeds need water to germinate. Indeed, the absorption of water activates the hydrolytic enzymes, which break down food resources stored in seeds and provide energy for germination. As the consequence, there is a very close relationship between water content in the substrate and germination velocity: the higher the water content the quickest the germination, as long as the availability of oxygen does not become a problem (well, water and oxygen in soil may compete for space and a high water content may result in oxygen shortage).</p>...</p>

The next step is to fit this function to the observed data, possibly by using some sort of nonlinear least squares algorithms. These algorithms are iterative, in the sense that they start from some initial values of model parameters and repeat a sequence of operations, which continuously improve the initial guesses, until the least squares solution is approximately reached.</p>...</p>

                            <p><p>(Post updated on 17/07/2023) In R, the <code>drc</code> package represents one of the main solutions for nonlinear regression and dose-response analyses (Ritz et al., 2015). It comes with a lot of nonlinear models, which are useful to describe several biological processes, from plant growth to bioassays, from herbicide degradation to seed germination. These models are provided with self-starting functions, which free the user from the hassle of providing initial guesses for model parameters. Indeed, getting these guesses may be a tricky task, both for students and for practitioners.</p>...</p>

                            <p><p>Nonlinear regression plays an important role in my research and teaching activities. While I often use the ‘drm()’ function in the ‘drc’ package for my research work, I tend to prefer the ‘nls()’ function for teaching purposes, mainly because, in my opinion, the transition from linear models to nonlinear models is smoother, for beginners. One problem with ‘nls()’ is that, in contrast to ‘drm()’, it is not specifically tailored to the needs of biologists or students in biology. Therefore, now and then, I have to build some helper functions, to perform some specific tasks; I usually share these functions within the ‘aomisc’ package, that is available on github (<a href="https://www.statforbiology.com/rpackages/">see this link</a>).</p>...</p>

<h1>Fitting ‘complex’ mixed models with ‘nlme’: Example #4</h1>
<p>Factorial experiments are very common in agriculture and they are usually laid down to test for the significance of interactions between experimental factors. For example, genotype assessments may be performed at two different nitrogen fertilisation levels (e.g. high and low) to understand whether the ranking of genotypes depends on nutrient availability. For those of you who are not very much into agriculture, I will only say that such an assessment is relevant, because we need to know whether we can recommend the same genotypes, e.g., both in conventional agriculture (high nitrogen availability) and in organic agriculture (relatively lower nitrogen availability).</p>...</p>

                            <p><p>Very often, seed scientists need to compare the germination behaviour of different seed populations, e.g., different plant species, or one single plant species submitted to different temperatures, light conditions, priming treatments and so on. How should such a comparison be performed?</p>
<p>Let’s take a practical approach and start from an appropriate example: a few years ago, some collegues studied the germination behaviour for seeds of a plant species (<em>Verbascum arcturus</em>, BTW…), in different conditions. In detail, they considered the factorial combination of two storage periods (LONG and SHORT storage) and two temperature regimes (FIX: constant daily temperature of 20°C; ALT: alternating daily temperature regime, with 25°C during daytime and 15°C during night time, with a 12:12h photoperiod). If you are a seed scientist and are interested in this experiment, you’ll find detail in Catara <em>et al.</em> (2016).</p>...</p>

<h1>The background</h1>
<p>Seed germination data describe the time until an event of interest occurs. In this sense, they are very similar to survival data, apart from the fact that we deal with a different (and less sad) event: germination instead of death. But, seed germination data are also similar to failure-time data, phenological data, time-to-remission data… the first point is: <strong>germination data are time-to-event data</strong>.</p>
<p>You may wonder: what’s the matter with time-to-event data? Do they have anything special? With few exceptions, all time-to-event data are affected by a certain form of uncertainty, which takes the name of ‘censoring’. It relates to the fact that the exact time of event may not be precisely know. I think it is good to give an example.</p>...</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Very rarely, biological processes follow linear trends. Just think about how a crop grows, or responds to increasing doses of fertilisers/xenobiotics. Or think about how an herbicide degrades in the soil, or about the germination pattern of a seed population. It is very easy to realise that curvilinear trends are far more common than linear trends. Furthermore, asymptotes and/or inflection points are very common in nature. We can be sure: linear equations in biology are just a way to approximate a response over a very narrow range for the independent variable.</p>...</p>
