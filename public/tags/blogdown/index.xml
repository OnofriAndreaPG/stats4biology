      <description>This is my first day at work with blogdown. I must admit it is pretty overwhelming at the beginning &amp;hellip;
I thought that it might be useful to write down a few notes, to summarise my steps ahead, during the learning process. I do not work with blogdown everyday and I tend to forget things quite easily. Therefore, these notes may help me recap how far I have come. And they might also help other beginners, to speed up their initial steps with such a powerful blogging platform.</description>

      <description>This is my first day at work with blogdown. I must admit it is pretty overwhelming at the beginning &amp;hellip;
I worked with R Studio and installed the library &amp;lsquo;blogdown&amp;rsquo;. I followed the instructions and used the &amp;lsquo;NEW PROJECT&amp;rsquo; menu and added a &amp;lsquo;NEW BLOGDOWN SITE&amp;rsquo; to my file system. I selected the &amp;lsquo;hugo-blog-jeffprod&amp;rsquo; theme. This created a bunch of directories in my working directory. If I use the &amp;lsquo;serve_site()&amp;rsquo; function in console, the Hugo server is called and the site is continuously updated, as soon as I make changes and save them.</description>
